abstract = "Blocking Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) can reinvigorate exhausted CD8 T cells (TEX) and improve control of chronic infections and cancer. However, whether blocking PD-1 can reprogram TEX into durable memory T cells (TMEM) is unclear. We found that reinvigoration of TEX in mice by PD-L1 blockade caused minimal memory development. After blockade, reinvigorated TEX became reexhausted if antigen concentration remained high and failed to become TMEM upon antigen clearance. TEX acquired an epigenetic profile distinct from that of effector T cells (TEFF) and TMEM cells that was minimally remodeled after PD-L1 blockade. This finding suggests that TEX are a distinct lineage of CD8 T cells. Nevertheless, PD-1 pathway blockade resulted in transcriptional rewiring and reengagement of effector circuitry in the TEX epigenetic landscape. These data indicate that epigenetic fate inflexibility may limit current immunotherapies.",

We combine ICS with CRISPR-pooled screens to identify regulators of the nuclear factor $\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) pathway, enabling the completion of genome-wide image-based screens in about 9 hours of run time.

abstract = "Abstract 1299Background: Loss-of-function mutations in TET2 are frequent in human myeloid and lymphoid malignancies. Especially, TET2 mutations were found in 30--47\% of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) and 10--38\% of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL, NOS). The tumor origin of AITL is thought to be follicular helper T cells (Tfh). PTCL, NOS is a group of heterogenous T-cell-derived lymphomas, whereas some cases of PTCL, NOS also appear to be derived from Tfh. Several recent papers reported that Tet2 knockout mice demonstrated premalignant status of myeloid lineages, implicating that TET2 mutations have a driver9s role in myeloid malignancies; however, there are no clues to how impaired Tet2 function provokes T-cell lymphomas. To address this issue, we analyzed Tet2 gene trap (Tet2gt) mice.Materials and methods: Tet2gt mice (Transgenic Res 17:599, 2008) have a trapping vector inserted into the second intron of Tet2 locus. Lineage-, Sca1+, and c-kit+ (LSK) cells were sorted from Tet2gt E15.5 fetal liver (FL) cells and transplanted into lethally irradiated Ly5.1 wild-type (WT) mice. Bone marrow, spleen, and tumors when developed were analyzed in the recipient mice as well as adult Tet2gtmice by flow cytometory and immunohistochemical staining.Result: Adult Tet2gt mice were obtained under the following ratio; Tet2+/+:Tet2+/gt:Tet2gt/gt=48:52:25. TET2 mRNA expression level in Tet2gt/gt Lin- FL cells was reduced to 20\% of that in WT Lin- FL cells, while the 5-hydroxymethyl cytosine level was reduced to around a half of that in WT cells. At 40 weeks of age, the proportion of CD4+/PD1+/Cxcr5+ cells, immunophenotypically similar to Tfh cells, significantly increased in Tet2gt/gt mice compared to WT mice (P=0.022). Two out of 8 Tet2gt/gt mice developed marked splenomegaly (more than 300 mg) at 40 weeks, and 4 out of 6 developed marked splenomegaly with swollen lymph nodes and multi-nodular tumors in liver and lungs at 60 weeks or older (median, 67 weeks). Histological examination of the enlarged spleen and swollen lymph nodes in these 4 mice demonstrated completely destroyed follicular structures. The spleen, lymph nodes, and nodular tumors showed infiltration of morphologically abnormal lymphocytes, which were proven to be CD4+/PD1+ T cells. These cells were also weakly positive for Cxcr5. CD4+ cells purified from the tumors revealed restricted rearrangement patterns of T-cell receptor genes, implying T-cell lymphoma. There were no increased vascular structures representing AITL. CD4+/PD1+ cells purified from the tumors expressed Bcl6 and cMaf, two key transcription factors of Tfh, at significantly higher levels compared to CD4+/PD1+ cells purified from spleen of WT mice. Meanwhile, one of 6 mice transplanted with Tet2gt/gt LSK cells also developed lymphoma with similar pattern of CD4+/PD1+/CXCR5 expression at 40 weeks after transplantation.Discussion: Our observations indicate that reduced expression of TET2 may cause skewed differentiation into Tfh, which eventually develop tumors that pathologically recapitulate PTCL, NOS in human, while the tumor-comprising cells show characteristics of Tfh. The long latency period required for tumor development indicates secondary genetic hits in addition to the downregulation of TET2. These secondary events might determine the specificity of the hematologic malignancies, particularly AITL and PCTL, NOS with propensity for AITL.Disclosures: No relevant conflicts of interest to declare.",

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing and immunnopeptidomics have increased the precision of HLA-I sub-allele classification, and have led to the discovery of peptide processing events and individual allele-specific binding preferences.

abstract = "Forkhead box (FOX) proteins represent a large family of transcriptional regulators unified by their DNA binding domain (DBD) known as a 'forkhead' or 'winged helix' domain. Over 40 FOX genes have been identified in the mammalian genome. FOX proteins share significant sequence similarities in the DBD which allow them to bind to a consensus DNA response element. However, their modes of action are quite diverse as they regulate gene expression by acting as pioneer factors, transcription factors, or both. This review focuses on the mechanisms of chromatin remodeling with an emphasis on three sub-classes-FOXA, FOXO, and FOXP members. FOXA proteins serve as pioneer factors to open up local chromatin structure and thereby increase accessibility of chromatin to factors regulating transcription. FOXP proteins, in contrast, function as classic transcription factors to recruit a variety of chromatin modifying enzymes to regulate gene expression. FOXO proteins represent a hybrid subclass having dual roles as pioneering factors and transcription factors. A subset of FOX proteins interacts with condensed mitotic chromatin and may function as 'bookmarking' agents to maintain transcriptional competence at specific genomic sites. The overall diversity in chromatin remodeling function by FOX proteins is related to unique structural motifs present within the DBD flanking regions that govern selective interactions with core histones and/or chromatin coregulatory proteins.

Social media platforms seem to be losing the battle against online hate19,20 and urgently need new insights. Here we show that the key to understanding the resilience of online hate lies in its global network-of-network dynamics. Interconnected hate clusters form global 'hate highways' that-assisted by collective online adaptations-cross social media platforms, sometimes using 'back doors' even after being banned, as well as jumping between countries, continents and languages. Our mathematical model predicts that policing within a single platform (such as Facebook) can make matters worse, and will eventually generate global 'dark pools' in which online hate will flourish. We observe the current hate network rapidly rewiring and self-repairing at the micro level when attacked, in a way that mimics the formation of covalent bonds in chemistry. This understanding enables us to propose a policy matrix that can help to defeat online hate, classified by the preferred (or legally allowed) granularity of the intervention and top-down versus bottom-up nature. We provide quantitative assessments for the effects of each intervention. This policy matrix also offers a tool for tackling a broader class of illicit online behaviours21,22 such as financial fraud.",

abstract = "MOTIVATION: Viruses populate their hosts as a viral quasispecies: a collection of genetically related mutant strains. Viral quasispecies assembly is the reconstruction of strain-specific haplotypes from read data, and predicting their relative abundances within the mix of strains is an important step for various treatment-related reasons. Reference-genome-independent (``de novo'') approaches have yielded benefits over reference-guided approaches, because reference-induced biases can become overwhelming when dealing with divergent strains. While being very accurate, extant de novo methods only yield rather short contigs. The remaining challenge is to reconstruct full-length haplotypes together with their abundances from such contigs. RESULTS: We present Virus-VGas a de novo approach to viral haplotype reconstruction from pre-assembled contigs. Our method constructs a variation graph from the short input contigs without making use of a reference genome. Then, to obtain paths through the variation graph that reflect the original haplotypes, we solve a minimization problem that yields a selection of maximal-length paths that is optimal in terms of being compatible with the read coverages computed for the nodes of the variation graph. We output the resulting selection of maximal length paths as the haplotypes, together with their abundances. Benchmarking experiments on challenging simulated and real data sets show significant improvements in assembly contiguity compared to the input contigs, while preserving low error rates compared to the state-of-the-art viral quasispecies assemblers.

By sequencing V kappa Ox1 L-chains characteristic of phOx-specific antibodies, we show that somatic mutations accumulate in germinal center B cells and that a mutation conferring high affinity binding is found with increasing frequency. An analysis of V/D/J rearrangements suggests that this mutation occurred independently in many B cells, which were then preferentially expanded.

We evaluated the effects of the caspase-1 inhibitor VX-765 on HIV-1 infection in humanized NSG mice engrafted with human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells. Expression of caspase-1, NLRP3, and IL-1$\beta$ was increased in lymph nodes and bone marrow between day 1 and 3 after HIV-1 infection (mean fold change (FC) of 2.08, 3.23, and 6.05, p+ T cells loss in blood (p+ T cells (44.3\% vs 36,7\%, p=0.01), viral load (4.26 vs 4.89 log 10 copies/ml, p=0.027), and total HIV-1 DNA in the spleen (1 054 vs 2 889 copies /106 cells, p=0.029).

abstract = "Fatty acid (FA) content affects the sensorial and nutritional value of meat and plays a significant role in biological processes such as adipogenesis and immune response. It is well known that, in beef, the main FAs associated with these biological processes are oleic acid (C18:1 cis9, OA) and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA-c9t11), which may have beneficial effects on metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and obesity. Here, we performed differential expression and co-expression analyses, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and partial correlation with information theory (PCIT), to uncover the complex interactions between miRNAs and mRNAs expressed in skeletal muscle associated with FA content. miRNA and mRNA expression data were obtained from skeletal muscle of Nelore cattle that had extreme genomic breeding values for OA and CLA. Insulin and MAPK signaling pathways were identified by WGCNA as central pathways associated with both of these fatty acids. Co-expression network analysis identified bta-miR-33a/b, bta-miR-100, bta-miR-204, bta-miR-365-5p, bta-miR-660, bta-miR-411a, bta-miR-136, bta-miR-30-5p, bta-miR-146b, bta-let-7a-5p, bta-let-7f, bta-let-7, bta-miR 339, bta-miR-10b, bta-miR 486, and the genes ACTA1 and ALDOA as potential regulators of fatty acid synthesis.

By learning effectively even from a small amount of data, our approach overcomes a major limitation of standard deep neural networks.

abstract = "OBJECTIVE: CD4+ T cells are the main target for HIV. However, the highest HIV antigen concentration in infected subjects accumulates on the cell surface of follicular dendritic cells in the germinal centres of the lymphoid tissue. Germinal centres contain a T-helper cell subset which expresses CD57 molecules. Here we analysed virus replication and viral load in CD57+CD4+ germinal centre T cells and in the CD4+ T cells found mostly outside germinal centres (CD57-CD4+). METHODS: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and lymph-node cells were prepared, stained for CD4 and CD57 and purified by FACS. Defined cell numbers of CD4+CD57+ cells and CD4+CD57- cells were sorted directly into polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tubes by FACS, equipped with an automated cell deposition unit and analysed by PCR to detect proviral DNA. Based on Poisson distribution, the expected level of infection was calculated. Viral replication was determined by amplifying double-spliced, single-spliced, and full-length transcripts of HIV using serially diluted cDNA of the FACS-sorted cells. RESULTS: An up to 10-fold higher frequency of infected cells was found in the CD57+CD4+ germinal centre T cells compared with CD57-CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, active viral replication was detected almost exclusively in the CD57+CD4+ T cells. CONCLUSIONS: The CD57+CD4+ germinal centre T cells are one of the sites of HIV infection and replication that may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection.",

abstract = "All major biological processes start after protein molecules known as transcription factors detect specific regulatory sequences on DNA and initiate genetic expression by associating to them. But in eukaryotic cells, much of the DNA is covered by nucleosomes and other chromatin structures, preventing transcription factors from binding to their targets. At the same time, experimental studies show that there are several classes of proteins, called ``pioneer transcription factors'', that are able to reach the targets on nucleosomal DNA; however, the underlying microscopic mechanisms remain not well understood. We propose a new theoretical approach that might explain how pioneer transcription factors can find their targets. It is argued that pioneer transcription factors might weaken the interactions between the DNA and nucleosome by substituting them with similar interactions between transcription factors and DNA. Using this idea, we develop a discrete-state stochastic model that allows for exact calculations of target search dynamics on nucleosomal DNA using first-passage probabilities approach. It is found that the target search on nuclesomal DNA for pioneer transcription factors might be significantly accelerated while the search is slower on naked DNA in comparison with normal transcription factors. Our theoretical predictions are supported by Monte Carlo computer simulations, and they also agree with available experimental observations.",

Here we identify positive regulators of T cell functions through overexpression of around 12,000 barcoded human open reading frames (ORFs). The top-ranked genes increased the proliferation and activation of primary human CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and their secretion of key cytokines such as interleukin-2 and interferon-$\gamma$. In addition, we developed the single-cell genomics method OverCITE-seq for high-throughput quantification of the transcriptome and surface antigens in ORF-engineered T cells. The top-ranked ORF-lymphotoxin-$\beta$ receptor (LTBR)-is typically expressed in myeloid cells but absent in lymphocytes. When overexpressed in T cells, LTBR induced profound transcriptional and epigenomic remodelling, leading to increased T cell effector functions and resistance to exhaustion in chronic stimulation settings through constitutive activation of the canonical NF-$\kappa$B pathway. LTBR and other highly ranked genes improved the antigen-specific responses of chimeric antigen receptor T cells and $\gamma$$\delta$ T cells, highlighting their potential for future cancer-agnostic therapies5.

The two isoforms are naturally expressed in humans, yet their differences in controlling regulatory T cell phenotype and functionality remain unclear. In this study, we show that patients expressing only the shorter isoform fail to maintain self-tolerance and develop immunodeficiency, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy X-linked (IPEX) syndrome. Mice with Foxp3 exon 2 deletion have excessive follicular helper T (TFH) and germinal center B (GC B) cell responses, and develop systemic autoimmune disease with anti-dsDNA and antinuclear autoantibody production, as well as immune complex glomerulonephritis. Despite having normal suppressive function in in vitro assays, regulatory T cells expressing FOXP3 $\Delta$E2 are unstable and sufficient to induce autoimmunity when transferred into Tcrb-deficient mice. Mechanistically, the FOXP3 $\Delta$E2 isoform allows increased expression of selected cytokines, but decreased expression of a set of positive regulators of Foxp3 without altered binding to these gene loci. These findings uncover indispensable functions of the FOXP3 exon 2 region, highlighting a role in regulating a transcriptional program that maintains Treg stability and immune homeostasis.",

abstract = "Several functional classes of short noncoding RNAs are involved in manifold regulatory processes in eukaryotes, including, among the best characterized, miRNAs. One of the most intriguing regulatory networks in the eukaryotic cell is the mito-nuclear crosstalk: recently, miRNA-like elements of mitochondrial origin, called smithRNAs, were detected in a bivalve species, Ruditapes philippinarum. These RNA molecules originate in the organelle but were shown in vivo to regulate nuclear genes. Since miRNA genes evolve easily de novo with respect to protein-coding genes, in the present work we estimate the probability with which a newly arisen smithRNA finds a suitable target in the nuclear transcriptome. Simulations with transcriptomes of 12 bivalve species suggest that this probability is high and not species specific: one in a hundred million (1 $\times$ 10−8) if five mismatches between the smithRNA and the 3' mRNA are allowed, yet many more are allowed in animals. We propose that novel smithRNAs may easily evolve as exaptation of the pre-existing mitochondrial RNAs. In turn, the ability of evolving novel smithRNAs may have played a pivotal role in mito-nuclear interactions during animal evolution, including the intriguing possibility of acting as speciation trigger.",

Here we use DNA barcoding to track murine mammary cancer cell clones during immunoediting and determine clonal transcriptional profiles that allow immune evasion following anti-PD1 plus anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy. Clonal diversity is significantly restricted by immunotherapy treatment in both primary tumours and metastases, demonstrating selection for pre-existing breast cancer cell populations and ongoing immunoediting during metastasis and treatment. Immunotherapy resistant clones express a common gene signature associated with poor survival of basal-like breast cancer patient cohorts. At least one of these genes has an existing small molecule that can potentially be used to improve immunotherapy response.

It is believed that Pol II is recruited back to active genes only after chromatin is rebuilt3,4. However, there is little experimental evidence addressing the central questions of when and how Pol II is recruited back to the daughter strands and resumes transcription. Here we show that immediately after passage of the replication fork, Pol II in complex with other general transcription proteins and immature RNA re-associates with active genes on both leading and lagging strands of nascent DNA, and rapidly resumes transcription. This suggests that the transcriptionally active Pol II complex is retained in close proximity to DNA, with a Pol II--PCNA interaction potentially underlying this retention. These findings indicate that the Pol II machinery may not require epigenetic marks to be recruited to the newly synthesized DNA during the transition from DNA replication to resumption of transcription. Protein complexes containing RNA polymerase II and immature RNA are associated with active genes immediately after replication, suggesting that transmission of active transcriptional states to daughter cells may not require any additional epigenetic bookmarks.",

Here we present a statistical algorithm called CellDMC ( https://github.com/sjczheng/EpiDISH ), which can identify differentially methylated positions and the specific cell type(s) driving the differential methylation. We validated CellDMC on in silico mixtures of DNA methylation data generated with different technologies, as well as on real mixtures from epigenome-wide association and cancer epigenome studies. CellDMC achieved over 90\% sensitivity and specificity in scenarios where current state-of-the-art methods did not identify differential methylation. By applying CellDMC to an EWAS performed in buccal swabs, we identified smoking-associated differentially methylated positions occurring in the epithelial compartment, which we validated in smoking-related lung cancer. CellDMC may be useful in the identification of causal DNA-methylation alterations in disease.",

Furthermore, we outline a method for phasing singletons, which, although less precise, constitutes an important step towards future developments. We then demonstrate that the use of UKB as a reference panel improves the accuracy of genotype imputation, which is even more pronounced when phased with SHAPEIT5 compared with other methods. Finally, we screen the UKB data for loss-of-function compound heterozygous events and identify 549 genes where both gene copies are knocked out.

Those TFs create open chromatin regions, promote histone acetylation on enhancers, and activate transcription. Here, we use the panel of single, double and triple mutants for zebrafish genome activators Pou5f3, Sox19b and Nanog, multi-omics and mathematical modeling to investigate the combinatorial mechanisms of genome activation. We show that Pou5f3 and Nanog act differently on synergistic and antagonistic enhancer types. Pou5f3 and Nanog both bind as pioneer-like TFs on synergistic enhancers, promote histone acetylation and activate transcription. Antagonistic enhancers are activated by binding of one of these factors. The other TF binds as non-pioneer-like TF, competes with the activator and blocks all its effects, partially or completely. This activator-blocker mechanism mutually restricts widespread transcriptional activation by Pou5f3 and Nanog and prevents premature expression of late developmental regulators in the early embryo.",

Footprints of photoreceptor and RPE-specific transcription factors are enriched in differentially accessible regions (DARs). Genes associated with DARs show altered expression in AMD. Cigarette smoke treatment of RPE cells recapitulates chromatin accessibility changes seen in AMD, providing an epigenetic link between a known risk factor for AMD and AMD pathology.

abstract = "Previous studies showed an increased prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) thumb subdomain polymorphisms Pro272, Arg277, and Thr286 in patients failing therapy with nucleoside analogue combinations. Interestingly, wild-type HIV-1(BH10) RT contains Pro272, Arg277, and Thr286. Here, we demonstrate that in the presence of zidovudine, HIV-1(BH10) RT mutations P272A/R277K/T286A produce a significant reduction of the viral replication capacity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in both the absence and presence of M41L/T215Y. In studies carried out with recombinant enzymes, we show that RT thumb subdomain mutations decrease primer-unblocking activity on RNA/DNA complexes, but not on DNA/DNA template-primers. These effects were observed with primers terminated with thymidine analogues (i.e., zidovudine and stavudine) and carbovir (the relevant derivative of abacavir) and were more pronounced when mutations were introduced in the wild-type HIV-1(BH10) RT sequence context. RT thumb subdomain mutations increased by 2-fold the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (K(d)) for RNA/DNA without affecting the K(d) for DNA/DNA substrates. RNase H assays carried out with RNA/DNA complexes did not reveal an increase in the reaction rate or in secondary cleavage events that could account for the decreased excision activity. The interaction of Arg277 with the phosphate backbone of the RNA template in HIV-1 RT bound to RNA/DNA and the location of Thr286 close to the RNA strand are consistent with thumb polymorphisms playing a role in decreasing nucleoside RT inhibitor excision activity on RNA/DNA template-primers by affecting interactions with the template-primer duplex without involvement of the RNase H activity of the enzyme.",

Transmitted preadapted and nonassociated polymorphisms showed opposing effects on set-point VL and the balance between the two was significantly associated with higher set-point VLs in a multivariable model including other risk factors. Transmitted preadaptation was also significantly associated with faster CD4 decline (<350 cells/µl) and this association was stronger after accounting for nonassociated polymorphisms, which were linked with slower CD4 decline. Overall, the relative ratio of the two classes of polymorphisms was found to be the major determinant of CD4 decline in a multivariable model including other risk factors.

abstract = "In healthy individuals, T cells react against incoming pathogens, but remain tolerant to self-antigens, thereby preventing autoimmune reactions. CD4 regulatory T cells are major contributors in induction and maintenance of peripheral tolerance, but a regulatory role has been also reported for several subsets of CD8 T cells. To determine the molecular basis of peripheral CD8 T-cell tolerance, we exploited a double transgenic mouse model in which CD8 T cells are neonatally tolerized following interaction with a parenchymal self-antigen. These tolerant CD8 T cells have regulatory capacity and can suppress T cells in an antigen-specific manner during adulthood. Dickkopf-3 (DKK3) was found to be expressed in the tolerant CD8 T cells and to be essential for the observed CD8 T-cell tolerance. In vitro, genetic deletion of DKK3 or blocking with antibodies restored CD8 T-cell proliferation and IL-2 production in response to the tolerizing self-antigen. Moreover, exogenous DKK3 reduced CD8 T-cell reactivity. In vivo, abrogation of DKK3 function reversed tolerance, leading to eradication of tumors expressing the target antigen and to rejection of autologous skin grafts. Thus, our findings define DKK3 as a immune modulator with a crucial role for CD8 T-cell tolerance.",

Although chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 5-expressing T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are important in humoral immunity, their developmental regulation is unclear. Here we show that Tfh cells had a distinct gene expression profile and developed in vivo independently of the Th1 or Th2 cell lineages. Tfh cell generation was regulated by ICOS ligand (ICOSL) expressed on B cells and was dependent on interleukin-21 (IL-21), IL-6, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). However, unlike Th17 cells, differentiation of Tfh cells did not require transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) or Th17-specific orphan nuclear receptors RORalpha and RORgamma in vivo. Finally, naive T cells activated in vitro in the presence of IL-21 but not TGF-beta signaling preferentially acquired Tfh gene expression and promoted germinal-center reactions in vivo. This study thus demonstrates that Tfh is a distinct Th cell lineage.",

Acute treatment with IL-9 or antibody to IL-9 accelerated or retarded the positioning of GC-MP cells toward the GC edge and exit from the GC, and enhanced or inhibited the development of memory B cells, which required B cell-intrinsic responsiveness to IL-9. Follicular helper T cells (TFHcells) produced IL-9, and deletion of IL-9 from T cells or, more specifically, from GC TFHcells led to impaired memory formation of B cells.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that these lymphoma cells had Tfh-like gene expression patterns when compared with splenic CD4-positive cells of wild-type mice. The lymphoma cells showed lower hmC densities around the transcription start site (TSS) and higher mC densities at the regions of the TSS, gene body and CpG islands. These epigenetic changes, seen in Tet2 insufficiency-triggered lymphoma, possibly contributed to predated outgrowth of Tfh-like cells and subsequent lymphomagenesis.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The continued advance of antibiotic resistance threatens the treatment and control of many infectious diseases. This is exemplified by the largest global outbreak of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis (TB) identified in Tugela Ferry, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, in 2005 that continues today. It is unclear whether the emergence of XDR-TB in KwaZulu-Natal was due to recent inadequacies in TB control in conjunction with HIV or other factors. Understanding the origins of drug resistance in this fatal outbreak of XDR will inform the control and prevention of drug-resistant TB in other settings. In this study, we used whole genome sequencing and dating analysis to determine if XDR-TB had emerged recently or had ancient antecedents. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed whole genome sequencing and drug susceptibility testing on 337 clinical isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis collected in KwaZulu-Natal from 2008 to 2013, in addition to three historical isolates, collected from patients in the same province and including an isolate from the 2005 Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolate from 1994, and a pansusceptible isolate from 1995. We utilized an array of whole genome comparative techniques to assess the relatedness among strains, to establish the order of acquisition of drug resistance mutations, including the timing of acquisitions leading to XDR-TB in the LAM4 spoligotype, and to calculate the number of independent evolutionary emergences of MDR and XDR. Our sequencing and analysis revealed a 50-member clone of XDR M. tuberculosis that was highly related to the Tugela Ferry XDR outbreak strain. We estimated that mutations conferring isoniazid and streptomycin resistance in this clone were acquired 50 y prior to the Tugela Ferry outbreak (katG S315T [isoniazid]; gidB 130 bp deletion [streptomycin]; 1957 [95\% highest posterior density (HPD): 1937-1971]), with the subsequent emergence of MDR and XDR occurring 20 y (rpoB L452P [rifampicin]; pncA 1 bp insertion [pyrazinamide]; 1984 [95\% HPD: 1974-1992]) and 10 y (rpoB D435G [rifampicin]; rrs 1400 [kanamycin]; gyrA A90V [ofloxacin]; 1995 [95\% HPD: 1988-1999]) prior to the outbreak, respectively. We observed frequent de novo evolution of MDR and XDR, with 56 and nine independent evolutionary events, respectively. Isoniazid resistance evolved before rifampicin resistance 46 times, whereas rifampicin resistance evolved prior to isoniazid only twice. We identified additional putative compensatory mutations to rifampicin in this dataset. One major limitation of this study is that the conclusions with respect to ordering and timing of acquisition of mutations may not represent universal patterns of drug resistance emergence in other areas of the globe. CONCLUSIONS: In the first whole genome-based analysis of the emergence of drug resistance among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, we show that the ancestral precursor of the LAM4 XDR outbreak strain in Tugela Ferry gained mutations to first-line drugs at the beginning of the antibiotic era. Subsequent accumulation of stepwise resistance mutations, occurring over decades and prior to the explosion of HIV in this region, yielded MDR and XDR, permitting the emergence of compensatory mutations. Our results suggest that drug-resistant strains circulating today reflect not only vulnerabilities of current TB control efforts but also those that date back 50 y. In drug-resistant TB, isoniazid resistance was overwhelmingly the initial resistance mutation to be acquired, which would not be detected by current rapid molecular diagnostics employed in South Africa that assess only rifampicin resistance.",

author = "Mokhtari, Ryan and Lachman, Herbert M",
abstract = "Epidemiological studies and mouse models suggest that maternal immune activation, induced clinically through prenatal exposure to one of several infectious diseases, is a risk factor in the development of schizophrenia. This is supported by the strong genetic association established by genome wide association studies (GWAS) between the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and schizophrenia. HLA proteins (also known in mice as the major histocompatibility complex; MHC) are mediators of the T-lymphocyte responses, and genetic variability is well-established as a risk factor for autoimmune diseases and susceptibility to infectious diseases. Taken together, the findings strongly suggest that schizophrenia risk in a subgroup of patients is caused by an infectious disease, and/or an autoimmune phenomenon. However, this view may be overly simplistic. First, MHC proteins have a non-immune effect on synaptogenesis by modulating synaptic pruning by microglia and other mechanisms, suggesting that genetic variability could be compromising this physiological process. Second, some GWAS signals in the HLA locus map near non-HLA genes, such as the histone gene cluster. On the other hand, recent GWAS data show association signals near B-lymphocyte enhancers, which lend support for an infectious disease etiology. Thus, although the genetic findings implicating the HLA locus are very robust, how genetic variability in this region leads to schizophrenia remains to be elucidated.",

With phylogenies of this size Felsenstein's bootstrap tends to yield very low supports, especially on deep branches. Here we propose a new version of the phylogenetic bootstrap in which the presence of inferred branches in replications is measured using a gradual 'transfer' distance rather than the binary presence or absence index used in Felsenstein's original version. The resulting supports are higher and do not induce falsely supported branches. The application of our method to large mammal, HIV and simulated datasets reveals their phylogenetic signals, whereas Felsenstein's bootstrap fails to do so.",

This selection can maintain allelic lineages for much longer periods of time than neutral polymorphisms are expected to last, but sharing of polymorphic amino acid motifs among species of different mammalian orders is due to independent (or convergent) evolution rather than common ancestry. It has been suggested that interallelic recombination (gene conversion) plays a role in enhancing polymorphism, but there is evidence of striking differences among loci with respect to the rate at which such recombination has contributed to current polymorphism. Recent attempts to interpret linkage relationships in the MHC region as evidence of ancient genomic duplications are not supported by phylogenetic analysis.

abstract = "Genome-wide analyses estimate that more than 90\% of multi exonic human genes produce at least two transcripts through alternative splicing (AS). Various bioinformatics methods are available to analyze AS from RNAseq data. Most methods start by mapping the reads to an annotated reference genome, but some start by a de novo assembly of the reads. In this paper, we present a systematic comparison of a mapping-first approach (FARLINE) and an assembly-first approach (KISSPLICE). We applied these methods to two independent RNAseq datasets and found that the predictions of the two pipelines overlapped (70\% of exon skipping events were common), but with noticeable differences. The assembly-first approach allowed to find more novel variants, including novel unannotated exons and splice sites. It also predicted AS in recently duplicated genes. The mapping-first approach allowed to find more lowly expressed splicing variants, and splice variants overlapping repeats. This work demonstrates that annotating AS with a single approach leads to missing out a large number of candidates, many of which are differentially regulated across conditions and can be validated experimentally. We therefore advocate for the combined use of both mapping-first and assembly-first approaches for the annotation and differential analysis of AS from RNAseq datasets.",

A subset of this sample (270 cases and 860 controls) was subsequently included in the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium-schizophrenia GWAS meta-analysis. RESULTS: One hundred eight SNPs were taken forward for replication in an independent sample of 13,195 cases and 31,021 control subjects. The most significant associations in discovery, corrected for genomic inflation, were (rs204999, p combined = 1.34 $\times$ 10(-9) and in combined samples (rs2523722 p combined = 2.88 $\times$ 10(-16)) mapped to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region.

RESULTS: Based on the gene expression distributions from 127 RNA-Seq experiments, we find evidence that 91\% $\pm$ 4\% of all annotated genes are sequenced at a frequency of 0.1 times per million bases mapped, regardless of sample source. Based on this observation, and combining this information with other parameters such as biological variation and technical variation that we empirically estimate from our large datasets, we developed a model to estimate the statistical power needed to identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-Seq experiments.

In this Review, we discuss (and illustrate with animations) an alternative, unifying mechanism of chromatin remodelling, which is based on the regulation of DNA translocation. We propose the 'hourglass' model of remodeller function, in which each remodeller subfamily utilizes diverse specialized proteins and protein domains to assist in nucleosome targeting or to differentially detect nucleosome epitopes. These modules converge to regulate a common DNA translocation mechanism, to inform the conserved ATPase 'motor' on whether and how to apply DNA translocation, which together achieve the various outcomes of chromatin remodelling: nucleosome assembly, chromatin access and nucleosome editing.",

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Gene set analysis (GSA) is a widely used strategy for gene expression data analysis based on pathway knowledge. GSA focuses on sets of related genes and has established major advantages over individual gene analyses, including greater robustness, sensitivity and biological relevance. However, previous GSA methods have limited usage as they cannot handle datasets of different sample sizes or experimental designs. RESULTS: To address these limitations, we present a new GSA method called Generally Applicable Gene-set Enrichment (GAGE). We successfully apply GAGE to multiple microarray datasets with different sample sizes, experimental designs and profiling techniques. GAGE shows significantly better results when compared to two other commonly used GSA methods of GSEA and PAGE. We demonstrate this improvement in the following three aspects: (1) consistency across repeated studies/experiments; (2) sensitivity and specificity; (3) biological relevance of the regulatory mechanisms inferred.GAGE reveals novel and relevant regulatory mechanisms from both published and previously unpublished microarray studies. From two published lung cancer data sets, GAGE derived a more cohesive and predictive mechanistic scheme underlying lung cancer progress and metastasis. For a previously unpublished BMP6 study, GAGE predicted novel regulatory mechanisms for BMP6 induced osteoblast differentiation, including the canonical BMP-TGF beta signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, Wnt signaling, and estrogen signaling pathways-all of which are supported by the experimental literature. CONCLUSION: GAGE is generally applicable to gene expression datasets with different sample sizes and experimental designs. GAGE consistently outperformed two most frequently used GSA methods and inferred statistically and biologically more relevant regulatory pathways.

They provide a critical mechanism for stable repression of genes and other DNA-dependent activities by restricting binding of trans-acting factors to cognate DNA sequences. Conversely they are engineered to be nearly meta-stable and disassembled (and reassembled) in a facile manner to allow rapid access to the underlying DNA during processes such as transcription, replication and DNA repair. Nucleosomes protect the genome from DNA damaging agents and provide a lattice onto which a myriad of epigenetic signals are deposited. Moreover, vast strings of nucleosomes provide a framework for assembly of the chromatin fiber and higher-order chromatin structures. Thus, in order to provide a foundation for understanding these functions, we present a review of the basic elements of nucleosome structure and stability, including the association of linker histones.",

abstract = "Nucleosomes are important for gene regulation because their arrangement on the genome can control which proteins bind to DNA. Currently, few human nucleosomes are thought to be consistently positioned across cells; however, this has been difficult to assess due to the limited resolution of existing data. We performed paired-end sequencing of micrococcal nuclease-digested chromatin (MNase-seq) from seven lymphoblastoid cell lines and mapped over 3.6 billion MNase-seq fragments to the human genome to create the highest-resolution map of nucleosome occupancy to date in a human cell type. In contrast to previous results, we find that most nucleosomes have more consistent positioning than expected by chance and a substantial fraction (8.7\%) of nucleosomes have moderate to strong positioning. In aggregate, nucleosome sequences have 10 bp periodic patterns in dinucleotide frequency and DNase I sensitivity; and, across cells, nucleosomes frequently have translational offsets that are multiples of 10 bp. We estimate that almost half of the genome contains regularly spaced arrays of nucleosomes, which are enriched in active chromatin domains. Single nucleotide polymorphisms that reduce DNase I sensitivity can disrupt the phasing of nucleosome arrays, which indicates that they often result from positioning against a barrier formed by other proteins. However, nucleosome arrays can also be created by DNA sequence alone. The most striking example is an array of over 400 nucleosomes on chromosome 12 that is created by tandem repetition of sequences with strong positioning properties. In summary, a large fraction of nucleosomes are consistently positioned--in some regions because they adopt favored sequence positions, and in other regions because they are forced into specific arrangements by chromatin remodeling or DNA binding proteins.",

However, it has been shown that HIV-specific CD8 T cells are infrequently found within germinal centers (GCs), a predominant site of active and latent HIV infection. We demonstrate that HIV infection induces marked changes in the phenotype, frequency, and localization of CD8 T cells within the lymph node (LN). Significantly increased frequencies of CD8 T cells in the B cell follicles and GCs were found in LNs from treated and untreated HIV-infected individuals. This profile was associated with persistent local immune activation but did not appear to be directly related to local viral replication. Follicular CD8 (fCD8) T cells, despite compromised cytokine polyfunctionality, showed good cytolytic potential characterized by high ex vivo expression of granzyme B and perforin. We used an anti-HIV/anti-CD3 bispecific antibody in a redirected killing assay and found that fCD8 T cells had better killing activity than did non-fCD8 T cells.

abstract = "The CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cell dichotomy is essential for effective cellular immunity. How individual T cell identity is established remains poorly understood. Here we show that the high-mobility group (HMG) transcription factors Tcf1 and Lef1 are essential for repressing CD4(+) lineage-associated genes including Cd4, Foxp3 and Rorc in CD8(+) T cells. Tcf1- and Lef1-deficient CD8(+) T cells exhibit histone hyperacetylation, which can be ascribed to intrinsic histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity in Tcf1 and Lef1. Mutation of five conserved amino acids in the Tcf1 HDAC domain diminishes HDAC activity and the ability to suppress CD4(+) lineage genes in CD8(+) T cells. These findings reveal that sequence-specific transcription factors can utilize intrinsic HDAC activity to guard cell identity by repressing lineage-inappropriate genes.",

abstract = "UNLABELLED: The nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin-associated protein complex. Although the subunit composition of the mammalian complex is fairly well characterized, less is known about the stability and dynamics of these interactions. Furthermore, detailed information regarding protein-protein interaction surfaces within the complex is still largely lacking. Here, we show that the NuRD complex interacts with a number of substoichiometric zinc finger-containing proteins. Some of these interactions are salt-sensitive (ZNF512B and SALL4), whereas others (ZMYND8) are not. The stoichiometry of the core subunits is not affected by high salt concentrations, indicating that the core complex is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Interestingly, the RBBP4 and RBBP7 proteins are sensitive to high nonionic detergent concentrations during affinity purification. In a subunit exchange assay with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC)-treated nuclear extracts, RBBP4 and RBBP7 were identified as dynamic core subunits of the NuRD complex, consistent with their proposed role as histone chaperones. Finally, using cross-linking MS, we have uncovered novel features of NuRD molecular architecture that complement our affinity purification-MS/MS data. Altogether, these findings extend our understanding of MBD3-NuRD structure and stability.

abstract = "The compact structure of the nucleosome limits DNA accessibility and inhibits the binding of most sequence-specific proteins. Nucleosomes are not randomly located on the DNA but positioned with respect to the DNA sequence, suggesting models in which critical binding sites are either exposed in the linker, resulting in activation, or buried inside a nucleosome, resulting in repression. The mechanisms determining nucleosome positioning are therefore of paramount importance for understanding gene regulation and other events that occur in chromatin, such as transcription, replication, and repair. Here, we review our current understanding of the major determinants of nucleosome positioning: DNA sequence, nonhistone DNA-binding proteins, chromatin-remodeling enzymes, and transcription. We outline the major challenges for the future: elucidating the precise mechanisms of chromatin opening and promoter activation, identifying the complexes that occupy promoters, and understanding the multiscale problem of chromatin fiber organization.",

abstract = "PURPOSE: To investigate the role of SET domain containing 7 (SETD7) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and determine whether SETD7 can be used as a predictor of overall survival in HCC patients. METHODS: mRNAs and proteins of SETD7 and related genes in HCC tumor samples and paired adjacent non-tumorous liver tissues (ANLTs) (n = 20) or culture cells were determined by quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot. Cell proliferation and apoptosis with SETD7 knockdown SMMC-7721 cells or SETD7 overexpressed HepG2 cells were analyzed by CCK8 assay or flow cytometry. Gene expression alterations in SETD7 knockdown of SMMC-7721 cells were determined by digital gene expression (DGE) profiling. Defined data on patients (n = 225) with HCC were retrieved for the further study. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were performed using paraffin tissues with tumor and ANLTs. SETD7 and related proteins were determined by TMAs immunohistochemistry. Statistical analyses were conducted to associate SETD7 expression with tumor features and patient outcomes, as well as related proteins expression. RESULTS: SETD7 expression was significantly higher in HCC tumor tissues than in ANLTs. SETD7 overexpression in vitro can promote HepG2 cell proliferation, whereas SETD7 knockdown can inhibit SMMC-7721 cell proliferation by regulating the cell cycle. SETD7 expression was significantly correlated with five genes expression. Increased SETD7 is associated with metastasis, recurrence, large tumor size, and poor tumor differentiation, and indicates poor prognosis in HCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: SETD7 plays a critical role in HCC, and its immunohistochemistry signature provides potential clinical significance for personalized prediction of HCC prognosis.",

abstract = "Adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling machines play a central role in gene regulation by manipulating chromatin structure. Most genes have a nucleosome-depleted region at the promoter and an array of regularly spaced nucleosomes phased relative to the transcription start site. In vitro, the three known yeast nucleosome spacing enzymes (CHD1, ISW1 and ISW2) form arrays with different spacing. We used genome-wide nucleosome sequencing to determine whether these enzymes space nucleosomes differently in vivo We find that CHD1 and ISW1 compete to set the spacing on most genes, such that CHD1 dominates genes with shorter spacing and ISW1 dominates genes with longer spacing. In contrast, ISW2 plays a minor role, limited to transcriptionally inactive genes. Heavily transcribed genes show weak phasing and extreme spacing, either very short or very long, and are depleted of linker histone (H1). Genes with longer spacing are enriched in H1, which directs chromatin folding. We propose that CHD1 directs short spacing, resulting in eviction of H1 and chromatin unfolding, whereas ISW1 directs longer spacing, allowing H1 to bind and condense the chromatin. Thus, competition between the two remodelers to set the spacing on each gene may result in a highly dynamic chromatin structure.",

Elaborate chromatin remodelling mechanisms have evolved that govern nucleosome organization at promoters, regulatory elements, and other functional regions in the genome. Analyses of chromatin landscape have uncovered a variety of mechanisms, including DNA sequence preferences, that can influence nucleosome positions. To identify major determinants of nucleosome organization in the human genome, we used deep sequencing to map nucleosome positions in three primary human cell types and in vitro. A majority of the genome showed substantial flexibility of nucleosome positions, whereas a small fraction showed reproducibly positioned nucleosomes. Certain sites that position in vitro can anchor the formation of nucleosomal arrays that have cell type-specific spacing in vivo. Our results unveil an interplay of sequence-based nucleosome preferences and non-nucleosomal factors in determining nucleosome organization within mammalian cells.",

abstract = "Nucleosomes cover most of the genome and are thought to be displaced by transcription factors in regions that direct gene expression. However, the modes of interaction between transcription factors and nucleosomal DNA remain largely unknown. Here we systematically explore interactions between the nucleosome and 220 transcription factors representing diverse structural families. Consistent with earlier observations, we find that the majority of the studied transcription factors have less access to nucleosomal DNA than to free DNA. The motifs recovered from transcription factors bound to nucleosomal and free DNA are generally similar. However, steric hindrance and scaffolding by the nucleosome result in specific positioning and orientation of the motifs. Many transcription factors preferentially bind close to the end of nucleosomal DNA, or to periodic positions on the solvent-exposed side of the DNA. In addition, several transcription factors usually bind to nucleosomal DNA in a particular orientation. Some transcription factors specifically interact with DNA located at the dyad position at which only one DNA gyre is wound, whereas other transcription factors prefer sites spanning two DNA gyres and bind specifically to each of them. Our work reveals notable differences in the binding of transcription factors to free and nucleosomal DNA, and uncovers a diverse interaction landscape between transcription factors and the nucleosome.",

To explore this ambivalent relationship between host and microbe, we analysed the memory humoral response against IsdB, a protein involved in iron acquisition, in four healthy donors.

In contrast to the typical antibody/antigen interactions, the binding is primarily driven by the germline-encoded hydrophobic CDRH-2 motifs of IGHV1-69 and IGHV4-39, with a binding mechanism nearly identical for each antibody derived from different donors. Our results suggest that IGHV1-69 and IGHV4-39, while part of the adaptive immune system, may have evolved under selection pressure to encode a binding motif innately capable of recognizing and neutralizing a structurally conserved protein domain involved in pathogen iron acquisition.",

This is primarily exerted through its nucleosome remodeling activity while deacetylation at H3K27 follows changes in gene expression. Additionally, NuRD activity influences association of RNA polymerase II at transcription start sites and subsequent nascent transcript production, thereby guiding the establishment of lineage-appropriate transcriptional programs. These findings provide a detailed molecular picture of genome-wide modulation of lineage-specific transcription by an essential chromatin remodeling complex as well as insight into the orchestration of molecular events involved in transcriptional transitions in vivo.

abstract = "Functionally exhausted T cells have high expression of the PD-1 inhibitory receptor, and therapies that block PD-1 signaling show promise for resolving chronic viral infections and cancer. By using human and murine systems of acute and chronic viral infections, we analyzed epigenetic regulation of PD-1 expression during CD8(+) T cell differentiation. During acute infection, naive to effector CD8(+) T cell differentiation was accompanied by a transient loss of DNA methylation of the Pdcd1 locus that was directly coupled to the duration and strength of T cell receptor signaling. Further differentiation into functional memory cells coincided with Pdcd1 remethylation, providing an adapted program for regulation of PD-1 expression. In contrast, the Pdcd1 regulatory region was completely demethylated in exhausted CD8(+) T cells and remained unmethylated even when virus titers decreased. This lack of DNA remethylation leaves the Pdcd1 locus poised for rapid expression, potentially providing a signal for premature termination of antiviral functions.",

author = "Lawrence, Moyra and Daujat, Sylvain and Schneider, Robert",
abstract = "The DNA of each cell is wrapped around histone octamers, forming so-called 'nucleosomal core particles'. These histone proteins have tails that project from the nucleosome and many residues in these tails can be post-translationally modified, influencing all DNA-based processes, including chromatin compaction, nucleosome dynamics, and transcription. In contrast to those present in histone tails, modifications in the core regions of the histones had remained largely uncharacterised until recently, when some of these modifications began to be analysed in detail. Overall, recent work has shown that histone core modifications can not only directly regulate transcription, but also influence processes such as DNA repair, replication, stemness, and changes in cell state. In this review, we focus on the most recent developments in our understanding of histone modifications, particularly those on the lateral surface of the nucleosome. This region is in direct contact with the DNA and is formed by the histone cores. We suggest that these lateral surface modifications represent a key insight into chromatin regulation in the cell. Therefore, lateral surface modifications form a key area of interest and a focal point of ongoing study in epigenetics.",

abstract = "A critical step in the analysis of large genome-wide gene expression datasets is the use of module detection methods to group genes into co-expression modules. Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.",

TCF-1 was further required for the accessibility of these regulatory elements and at the single-cell level, it dictated a coordinate opening of chromatin in T cells. TCF-1 expression in fibroblasts generated de novo chromatin accessibility even at chromatin regions with repressive marks, inducing the expression of T cell-restricted genes.

abstract = "A systems understanding of nuclear organization and events is critical for determining how cells divide, differentiate, and respond to stimuli and for identifying the causes of diseases. Chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWI/SNF have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes including gene expression, nuclear organization, centromere function, and chromosomal stability, and mutations in SWI/SNF components have been linked to several types of cancer. To better understand the biological processes in which chromatin remodeling proteins participate, we globally mapped binding regions for several components of the SWI/SNF complex throughout the human genome using ChIP-Seq. SWI/SNF components were found to lie near regulatory elements integral to transcription (e.g. 5' ends, RNA Polymerases II and III, and enhancers) as well as regions critical for chromosome organization (e.g. CTCF, lamins, and DNA replication origins). Interestingly we also find that certain configurations of SWI/SNF subunits are associated with transcripts that have higher levels of expression, whereas other configurations of SWI/SNF factors are associated with transcripts that have lower levels of expression. To further elucidate the association of SWI/SNF subunits with each other as well as with other nuclear proteins, we also analyzed SWI/SNF immunoprecipitated complexes by mass spectrometry. Individual SWI/SNF factors are associated with their own family members, as well as with cellular constituents such as nuclear matrix proteins, key transcription factors, and centromere components, implying a ubiquitous role in gene regulation and nuclear function. We find an overrepresentation of both SWI/SNF-associated regions and proteins in cell cycle and chromosome organization. Taken together the results from our ChIP and immunoprecipitation experiments suggest that SWI/SNF facilitates gene regulation and genome function more broadly and through a greater diversity of interactions than previously appreciated.",

HIV infection impacts the TFh response with evidence of aberrant TFh function observed in acute and chronic infection. Effective TFh responses are associated with the development of broadly neutralizing antibody responses to HIV and may be important for viral control. In addition, TFh are preferentially infected and act as a key reservoir for latent HIV infection.

abstract = "The cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is critical for the differentiation and proliferation of effector CD8+ cytotoxic T cells. IL-2 signaling is mediated through the tyrosine kinases JAK1 and JAK3. Because of the importance of this pathway in orchestrating immune responses, it is an attractive target for therapies, including tofacitinib, which inhibits JAK1/3 signaling and ameliorates autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Rollings et al . performed proteomic analysis of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells that were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-2, as well as those treated with tofacitinib, and identified proteins in IL-2--treated cells that were critical to maintain their effector function. In addition, IL-2 shaped the ability of these cells to respond to their environment by inducing the production of proteins involved in nutrient sensing and uptake, as well as in oxygen sensing. A factor involved in oxygen sensing was decreased in response to tofacitinib, giving important insights into how such drugs control immune cell function. Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Janus kinases (JAKs) regulate transcriptional programs and protein synthesis to promote the differentiation of effector CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Using high-resolution mass spectrometry, we generated an in-depth characterization of how IL-2 and JAKs configure the CTL proteome to control CTL function. We found that IL-2 signaling through JAK1 and JAK3 (JAK1/3) increased the abundance of a key subset of proteins to induce the accumulation of critical cytokines and effector molecules in T cells. Moreover, IL-2 maintained the concentration of proteins that support core metabolic processes essential for cellular fitness. One fundamental insight was the dominant role for IL-2 in stimulating effector T cells to detect microenvironmental cues. IL-2--JAK1/3 signaling pathways thus increased the abundance of nutrient transporters, nutrient sensors, and critical oxygen-sensing molecules. These data provide key insights into how IL-2 promotes T cell function and highlight signaling mechanisms and transcription factors that integrate oxygen sensing to transcriptional control of CD8+ T cell differentiation.",

abstract = "The expression of eukaryotic genes is regulated by cis-regulatory elements such as promoters and enhancers, which bind sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins. One of the great challenges in the gene regulation field is to characterise these elements. This involves the identification of transcription factor (TF) binding sites within regulatory elements that are occupied in a defined regulatory context. Digestion with DNase and the subsequent analysis of regions protected from cleavage (DNase footprinting) has for many years been used to identify specific binding sites occupied by TFs at individual cis-elements with high resolution. This methodology has recently been adapted for high-throughput sequencing (DNase-seq). In this study, we describe an imbalance in the DNA strand-specific alignment information of DNase-seq data surrounding protein-DNA interactions that allows accurate prediction of occupied TF binding sites. Our study introduces a novel algorithm, Wellington, which considers the imbalance in this strand-specific information to efficiently identify DNA footprints. This algorithm significantly enhances specificity by reducing the proportion of false positives and requires significantly fewer predictions than previously reported methods to recapitulate an equal amount of ChIP-seq data.

This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate.

title = "{WGCNA}: an {R} package for weighted correlation network analysis",
author = "Langfelder, Peter and Horvath, Steve",
abstract = "BACKGROUND: Correlation networks are increasingly being used in bioinformatics applications. For example, weighted gene co-expression network analysis is a systems biology method for describing the correlation patterns among genes across microarray samples. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) can be used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes, for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These methods have been successfully applied in various biological contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation network methodology have been described in separate publications, there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial. RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive collection of R functions for performing various aspects of weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes functions for network construction, module detection, gene selection, calculations of topological properties, data simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external software. Along with the R package we also present R software tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA package provides R functions for weighted correlation network analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression data.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: The analysis of modular gene co-expression networks is a well-established method commonly used for discovering the systems-level functionality of genes. In addition, these studies provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant molecular pathways underlying different diseases and conditions. RESULTS: In this paper, we present a fast and easy-to-use Bioconductor package named CEMiTool that unifies the discovery and the analysis of co-expression modules. Using the same real datasets, we demonstrate that CEMiTool outperforms existing tools, and provides unique results in a user-friendly html report with high quality graphs. Among its features, our tool evaluates whether modules contain genes that are over-represented by specific pathways or that are altered in a specific sample group, as well as it integrates transcriptomic data with interactome information, identifying the potential hubs on each network. We successfully applied CEMiTool to over 1000 transcriptome datasets, and to a new RNA-seq dataset of patients infected with Leishmania, revealing novel insights of the disease's physiopathology. CONCLUSION: The CEMiTool R package provides users with an easy-to-use method to automatically implement gene co-expression network analyses, obtain key information about the discovered gene modules using additional downstream analyses and retrieve publication-ready results via a high-quality interactive report.",

abstract = "Cell-type specific gene expression is regulated by the combinatorial action of transcription factors (TFs). In this study, we predict transcription factor (TF) combinations that cooperatively bind in a cell-type specific manner. We first divide DNase hypersensitive sites into cell-type specifically open vs. ubiquitously open sites in 64 cell types to describe possible cell-type specific enhancers. Based on the pattern contrast between these two groups of sequences we develop ``co-occurring TF predictor on Cell-Type specific Enhancers'' (coTRaCTE) - a novel statistical method to determine regulatory TF co-occurrences. Contrasting the co-binding of TF pairs between cell-type specific and ubiquitously open chromatin guarantees the high cell-type specificity of the predictions. coTRaCTE predicts more than 2000 co-occurring TF pairs in 64 cell types. The large majority (70\%) of these TF pairs is highly cell-type specific and overlaps in TF pair co-occurrence are highly consistent among related cell types. Furthermore, independently validated co-occurring and directly interacting TFs are significantly enriched in our predictions. Focusing on the regulatory network derived from the predicted co-occurring TF pairs in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) we find that it consists of three subnetworks with distinct functions: maintenance of pluripotency governed by OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG, regulation of early development governed by KLF4, STAT3, ZIC3 and ZNF148 and general functions governed by MYC, TCF3 and YY1. In summary, coTRaCTE predicts highly cell-type specific co-occurring TFs which reveal new insights into transcriptional regulatory mechanisms.",

In this study, we investigated the interplay between nucleosome remodeling, by either yeast ISW1a or SWI/SNF, and a bound TF. We found that a TF serves as a major barrier to ISW1a remodeling, and acts as a boundary for nucleosome repositioning. In contrast, SWI/SNF was able to slide a nucleosome past a TF, with concurrent eviction of the TF from the DNA, and the TF did not significantly impact the nucleosome positioning.

author = "Lemke, Greg",
abstract = "Tissue macrophages rapidly recognize and engulf apoptotic cells. These events require the display of so-called eat-me signals on the apoptotic cell surface, the most fundamental of which is phosphatidylserine (PtdSer). Externalization of this phospholipid is catalysed by scramblase enzymes, several of which are activated by caspase cleavage. PtdSer is detected both by macrophage receptors that bind to this phospholipid directly and by receptors that bind to a soluble bridging protein that is independently bound to PtdSer. Prominent among the latter receptors are the MER and AXL receptor tyrosine kinases. Eat-me signals also trigger macrophages to engulf virus-infected or metabolically traumatized, but still living, cells, and this 'murder by phagocytosis' may be a common phenomenon. Finally, the localized presentation of PtdSer and other eat-me signals on delimited cell surface domains may enable the phagocytic pruning of these 'locally dead' domains by macrophages, most notably by microglia of the central nervous system.",

abstract = "Elucidating the global function of a transcription factor implies the identification of its target genes and genomic binding sites. The role of chromatin in this context is unclear, but the dominant view is that factors bind preferentially to nucleosome-depleted regions identified as DNaseI-hypersensitive sites (DHS). Here we show by ChIP, MNase, and DNaseI assays followed by deep sequencing that the progesterone receptor (PR) requires nucleosomes for optimal binding and function. In breast cancer cells treated with progestins, we identified 25,000 PR binding sites (PRbs). The majority of these sites encompassed several copies of the hexanucleotide TGTYCY, which is highly abundant in the genome. We found that functional PRbs accumulate around progesterone-induced genes, mainly in enhancers. Most of these sites overlap with DHS but exhibit high nucleosome occupancy. Progestin stimulation results in remodeling of these nucleosomes with displacement of histones H1 and H2A/H2B dimers. Our results strongly suggest that nucleosomes are crucial for PR binding and hormonal gene regulation.",

abstract = "Immunotherapy strategies have been emerging as powerful weapons against cancer. Early clinical trials reveal that overall response to immunotherapy is low in breast cancer patients, suggesting that effective strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy are urgently needed. In this study, we investigated whether epigenetic reprograming by modulating histone methylation could enhance effector T lymphocyte trafficking and improve therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in breast cancer with focus on triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtype. In silico analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data shows that expression of histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is inversely associated with the levels of cytotoxic T cell-attracting chemokines (C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 and 10 (CXCL9, CXCL10)) and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in clinical TNBC specimens. Tiling chromatin immunoprecipitation study showed that re-expression of chemokines by LSD1 inhibition is associated with increased H3K4me2 levels at proximal promoter regions. Rescue experiments using concurrent treatment with small interfering RNA or inhibitor of chemokine receptors blocked LSD1 inhibitor-enhanced CD8+ T cell migration, indicating a critical role of key T cell chemokines in LSD1-mediated CD8+ lymphocyte trafficking to the tumor microenvironment. In mice bearing TNBC xenograft tumors, anti-PD-1 antibody alone failed to elicit obvious therapeutic effect. However, combining LSD1 inhibitors with PD-1 antibody significantly suppressed tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis, which was associated with reduced Ki-67 level and augmented CD8+ T cell infiltration in xenograft tumors. Overall, these results suggest that LSD1 inhibition may be an effective adjuvant treatment with immunotherapy as a novel management strategy for poorly immunogenic breast tumors.",

abstract = "Inactivation of ARID1A and other components of the nuclear SWI/SNF protein complex occurs at very high frequencies in a variety of human malignancies, suggesting a widespread role for the SWI/SNF complex in tumour suppression1. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we show that ARID1A-containing SWI/SNF complex (ARID1A-SWI/SNF) operates as an inhibitor of the pro-oncogenic transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ2. Using a combination of gain- and loss-of-function approaches in several cellular contexts, we show that YAP/TAZ are necessary to induce the effects of the inactivation of the SWI/SNF complex, such as cell proliferation, acquisition of stem cell-like traits and liver tumorigenesis. We found that YAP/TAZ form a complex with SWI/SNF; this interaction is mediated by ARID1A and is alternative to the association of YAP/TAZ with the DNA-binding platform TEAD. Cellular mechanotransduction regulates the association between ARID1A-SWI/SNF and YAP/TAZ. The inhibitory interaction of ARID1A-SWI/SNF and YAP/TAZ is predominant in cells that experience low mechanical signalling, in which loss of ARID1A rescues the association between YAP/TAZ and TEAD. At high mechanical stress, nuclear F-actin binds to ARID1A-SWI/SNF, thereby preventing the formation of the ARID1A-SWI/SNF-YAP/TAZ complex, in favour of an association between TEAD and YAP/TAZ. We propose that a dual requirement must be met to fully enable the YAP/TAZ responses: promotion of nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ, for example, by loss of Hippo signalling, and inhibition of ARID1A-SWI/SNF, which can occur either through genetic inactivation or because of increased cell mechanics. This study offers a molecular framework in which mechanical signals that emerge at the tissue level together with genetic lesions activate YAP/TAZ to induce cell plasticity and tumorigenesis.",

TOX is largely dispensable for TEFF and TMEM formation, but is critical for exhaustion and without TOX TEX do not form. TOX is induced by calcineurin and NFAT2 and operates in a feed-forward loop to become calcineurin independent and sustained in TEX.

The CXCR5+ SIV-specific CD8 T cells demonstrated enhanced polyfunctionality, restricted expansion of antigen-pulsed Tfh cells in vitro, and possessed a unique gene expression pattern related to Tfh and Th2 cells.

We classified genes into clusters depending on the proximity of H2A.Z to the TSS. The genes with no detectable H2A.Z showed lowest expression level, whereas H2A.Z was positioned closer to the TSS of genes with higher expression levels. We confirmed this relation between the proximity of H2A.Z and expression level in the brain. The proximity of histone variant H2A.Z, but not H3.3 to the TSS, over seven consecutive nucleosomes, was correlated with expression. Further, a nucleosome was positioned over the TSS of silenced genes while it was displaced to expose the TSS in highly expressed genes. Our results suggest that gene expression levels in vivo are determined by accessibility of the TSS and proximity of H2A.Z.",

Initial clues to a role in tumor suppression for SWI/SNF complexes came over a decade ago when the gene encoding the SMARCB1/SNF5 core subunit was found specifically inactivated in nearly all pediatric rhabdoid tumors. In the last three years, cancer-genome sequencing efforts have revealed an unexpectedly high mutation rate of SWI/SNF subunit genes, which are collectively mutated in 20\% of all human cancers and approach the frequency of p53 mutations. Here, we provide a background on these newly recognized tumor suppressor complexes, discuss mechanisms implicated in the tumor suppressor activity, and highlight findings that may lead to potential therapeutic targets for SWI/SNF-mutant cancers.",

The Ehmt2 gene is expressed in epiblast cells but is dispensable for global DNA methylation in embryogenesis. In contrast, EHMT2 regulates DNA methylation at specific sequences that include CpG-rich promoters of germline-specific genes. These loci are bound by EHMT2 in embryonic cells, are marked by H3K9 dimethylation, and have strongly reduced DNA methylation in Ehmt2(-/-) embryos. EHMT2 also plays a role in the maintenance of germline-derived DNA methylation at one imprinted locus, the Slc38a4 gene.

abstract = "Cytotoxic CD8 T cells exert their antiviral and antitumor activity primarily through the secretion of cytotoxic granules.

The expression of the cytotoxic granules was assessed in virus-specific CD8 T cells specific to influenza virus, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We observed a dichotomy between GrmK and perforin expression in virus-specific CD8 T cells. The profile in influenza virus-specific CD8 T cells was perforin(-) GrmB(-) GrmA(+/-) GrmK(+); in CMV-specific cells, it was perforin(+) GrmB(+) GrmA(+) GrmK(-/+); and in EBV- and HIV-1-specific cells, it was perforin(-/+) GrmB(+) GrmA(+) GrmK(+). On the basis of the delineation of memory and effector CD8 T cells with CD45RA and CD127, the GrmK(+) profile was associated with early-stage memory CD8 T-cell differentiation, the perforin(+) GrmB(+) GrmA(+) profile with advanced-stage differentiation, and the GrmB(+) GrmA(+) Grmk(+) profile with intermediate-stage differentiation. Furthermore, perforin and GrmB but not GrmA and GrmK correlated with cytotoxic activity. Finally, changes in antigen exposure in vitro and in vivo during primary HIV-1 infection and vaccination modulated cytotoxic granule profiles.

Accumulating data demonstrate specific roles for Bach2 in favoring regulatory T cell generation, restraining effector T cell differentiation, and potentiating memory T cell development. Evidence suggests that Bach2 regulates various facets of T cell function by repressing other key transcriptional regulators such as B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1.

In this study we found that GzmK can induce rapid reactive oxygen species generation and collapse of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsim). Blockade of reactive oxygen species production by antioxidant N-acetylcysteine or superoxide scavenger Tiron inhibits GzmK-induced cell death. Moreover GzmK targets mitochondria by cleaving Bid to generate its active form tBid, which disrupts the outer mitochondrial membrane leading to the release of cytochrome c and endonuclease G.

abstract = "Immunodominant T cell epitopes preferentially targeted in multiple individuals are the critical element of successful vaccines and targeted immunotherapies. However, the underlying principles of this ``convergence'' of adaptive immunity among different individuals remain poorly understood. To quantitatively describe epitope immunogenicity, here we propose a supervised machine learning framework generating probabilistic estimates of immunogenicity, termed ``immunogenicity scores,'' based on the numerical features computed through sequence-based simulation approximating the molecular scanning process of peptides presented onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) by the human T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. Notably, overlapping sets of intermolecular interaction parameters were commonly utilized in MHC-I and MHC-II prediction. Moreover, a similar simulation of individual TCR-peptide interaction using the same set of interaction parameters yielded correlates of TCR affinity. Pathogen-derived epitopes and tumor-associated epitopes with positive T cell reactivity generally had higher immunogenicity scores than non-immunogenic counterparts, whereas thymically expressed self-epitopes were assigned relatively low scores regardless of their immunogenicity annotation. Immunogenicity score dynamics among single amino acid mutants delineated the landscape of position- and residue-specific mutational impacts. Simulation of position-specific immunogenicity score dynamics detected residues with high escape potential in multiple epitopes, consistent with known escape mutations in the literature. This study indicates that targeting of epitopes by human adaptive immunity is to some extent directed by defined thermodynamic principles. The proposed framework also has a practical implication in that it may enable to more efficiently prioritize epitope candidates highly prone to T cell recognition in multiple individuals, warranting prospective validation across different cohorts.",

The molecular and cellular mechanisms of T cell migration out of blood vessels have been intensively studied over the past 30 years. By contrast, less is known about T cell trafficking through the lymphatic vasculature. This migratory process occurs in one manner within lymph nodes (LNs), where recirculating T cells continuously exit into efferent lymphatics to return to the blood circulation. In another manner, T cell trafficking through lymphatics also occurs in peripheral tissues, where T cells exit the tissue by means of afferent lymphatics, to migrate to draining LNs and back into blood.

A few negative binomial model-based methods have been developed to estimate sample size based on the parameters of a single gene. However, thousands of genes are quantified and tested for differential expression simultaneously in RNA-Seq experiments. Thus, additional issues should be carefully addressed, including the false discovery rate for multiple statistic tests, widely distributed read counts and dispersions for different genes.

Datasets from previous, similar experiments such as the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) can be used as a point of reference.

Methods failing to address these issues can return misleading information. We propose a novel quantification method designed to address these concerns. RESULTS: We present miR-MaGiC, a novel miRNA quantification method, implemented as a cross-platform tool in Java. miR-MaGiC performs stringent mapping to a core region of each miRNA and defines a meaningful set of target miRNA sequences by collapsing the miRNA space to ``functional groups''. We hypothesize that these two features, mapping stringency and collapsing, provide more optimal quantification to a more meaningful unit (i.e., miRNA family). We test miR-MaGiC and several published methods on 210 small RNA-seq libraries, evaluating each method's ability to accurately reflect global miRNA expression profiles. We define accuracy as total counts close to the total number of input reads originating from miRNAs.

abstract = "BACKGROUND: Despite advances made with the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the control of the HIV 1 infection, a cure has not been achieved because of the persistence of viral reservoirs. The major HIV reservoirs remain in the lymphoid follicles because of, among other factors, the partial absence of CD8 T-cells in these structures. Recently, lymphoid follicle-confined and circulating CD8 T-cells expressing the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) were described, possessing antiviral mechanisms that could help to control HIV replication. SETTING AND METHODS: By flow cytometry, we characterized the phenotype and function of circulating CXCR5-expressing CD8 T-cells in HIV-infected patients with natural or HAART-induced control of HIV replication. RESULTS: Circulating CXCR5-expressing CD8 T-cells exhibited low or null expression of the C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7) and had a transitional memory phenotype. Particular redistributions of CXCR5-expressing CD8 T-cells were found in HIV-infected patients, and they were partially restored by HAART. The frequency of CXCR5CCR7 CD8 T-cells was higher in spontaneous HIV controllers and negatively correlated with plasma HIV RNA levels. Total and HIV-specific CXCR5 CD8 T-cells were major producers of interleukin-21, and this function was positively associated with their interferon-$\gamma$ production.

Therefore, it is important to review them separately to signify their potential contribution to non-progressive HIV disease.

A comprehensive transcriptomic and open chromatin atlas of the rhesus macaque brain is key to a deeper understanding of the brain. Here we characterize the transcriptome of 416 brain samples from 52 regions of 8 rhesus macaque brains. We identify gene modules associated with specific brain regions like the cerebral cortex, pituitary, and thalamus. In addition, we discover 9703 novel intergenic transcripts, including 1701 coding transcripts and 2845 lncRNAs. Most of the novel transcripts are only expressed in specific brain regions or cortical regions of specific individuals. We further survey the open chromatin regions in the hippocampal CA1 and several cerebral cortical regions of the rhesus macaque brain using ATAC-seq, revealing CA1- and cortex-specific open chromatin regions. Our results add to the growing body of knowledge regarding the baseline transcriptomic and open chromatin profiles in the brain of the rhesus macaque.",

Here, we examined the molecular pathways that induce Bcl6 gene expression and underscore Bcl6-dependent function during Tfh cell commitment. Integration of genome-wide Bcl6 occupancy in Tfh cells and differential gene expression analyses suggested an important role for the transcription factor Tox2 in Tfh cell differentiation. Ectopic expression of Tox2 was sufficient to drive Bcl6 expression and Tfh development. In genome-wide ChIP-seq analyses, Tox2-bound loci associated with Tfh cell differentiation and function, including Bcl6. Tox2 binding was associated with increased chromatin accessibility at these sites, as measured by ATAC-seq. Tox2-/- mice exhibited defective Tfh differentiation, and inhibition of both Tox2 and the related transcription factor Tox abolished Tfh differentiation. Thus, a Tox2-Bcl6 axis establishes a transcriptional feed-forward loop that promotes the Tfh program.",

We observed a progressive and proliferation-associated global loss of DNA methylation in heterochromatic parts of the genome during Tmem cell differentiation. Furthermore, distinct gradually changing signatures in the epigenome and the transcriptome supported a linear model of memory development in circulating T cells, while tissue-resident BM-Tmem branched off with a unique epigenetic profile. Integrative analyses identified candidate master regulators of Tmem cell differentiation, including the transcription factor FOXP1.

Small numbers of Treg cells reside within lymphoid organs and peripheral tissues, but their contribution to immune tolerance is so significant that defects in Treg cell function cause catastrophic immune disorders. Since they were first discovered 20 years ago, efforts have been made to understand the differences in developmental processes between Treg cells and conventional T cells that determine the ultimate fate of the overall T-cell population. Transcription factor Foxp3 is crucial for Treg cell differentiation, but it is not the whole story. Owing to recent advances in Treg cell research, we are now on the verge of appreciating the comprehensive mechanisms underlying Treg cell generation.

abstract = "Regulatory T (Treg) cells, whose identity and function are defined by the transcription factor Foxp3, are indispensable for immune homeostasis. It is unclear whether Foxp3 exerts its Treg lineage specification function through active modification of the chromatin landscape and establishment of new enhancers or by exploiting a pre-existing enhancer landscape. Analysis of the chromatin accessibility of Foxp3-bound enhancers in Treg and Foxp3-negative T cells showed that Foxp3 was bound overwhelmingly to preaccessible enhancers occupied by its cofactors in precursor cells or a structurally related predecessor. Furthermore, the bulk of Foxp3-bound Treg cell enhancers lacking in Foxp3(-) CD4(+) cells became accessible upon T cell receptor activation prior to Foxp3 expression, and only a small subset associated with several functionally important genes were exclusively Treg cell specific. Thus, in a late cellular differentiation process, Foxp3 defines Treg cell functionality in an ``opportunistic'' manner by largely exploiting the preformed enhancer network instead of establishing a new enhancer landscape.",

We report that impaired expression of the transcription factor (TF) Helios by FoxP3(+) CD4 and Qa-1-restricted CD8 T(regs) results in defective regulatory activity and autoimmunity in mice. Helios-deficient T(regs) develop an unstable phenotype during inflammatory responses characterized by reduced FoxP3 expression and increased effector cytokine expression secondary to diminished activation of the STAT5 pathway. CD8 T(regs) also require Helios-dependent STAT5 activation for survival and to prevent terminal T cell differentiation. The definition of Helios as a key transcription factor that stabilizes T(regs) in the face of inflammatory responses provides a genetic explanation for a core property of T(regs).",

abstract = "Currently, the standard practice for assembling next-generation sequencing (NGS) reads of viral genomes is to summarize thousands of individual short reads into a single consensus sequence, thus confounding useful intra-host diversity information for molecular phylodynamic inference. It is hypothesized that a few viral strains may dominate the intra-host genetic diversity with a variety of lower frequency strains comprising the rest of the population. Several software tools currently exist to convert NGS sequence variants into haplotypes. Previous benchmarks of viral haplotype reconstruction programs used simulation scenarios that are useful from a mathematical perspective but do not reflect viral evolution and epidemiology. Here, we tested twelve NGS haplotype reconstruction methods using viral populations simulated under realistic evolutionary dynamics. We simulated coalescent-based populations that spanned known levels of viral genetic diversity, including mutation rates, sample size and effective population size, to test the limits of the haplotype reconstruction methods and to ensure coverage of predicted intra-host viral diversity levels (especially HIV-1). All twelve investigated haplotype callers showed variable performance and produced drastically different results that were mainly driven by differences in mutation rate and, to a lesser extent, in effective population size. Most methods were able to accurately reconstruct haplotypes when genetic diversity was low. However, under higher levels of diversity (e.g., those seen intra-host HIV-1 infections), haplotype reconstruction quality was highly variable and, on average, poor. All haplotype reconstruction tools, except QuasiRecomb and ShoRAH, greatly underestimated intra-host diversity and the true number of haplotypes. PredictHaplo outperformed, in regard to highest precision, recall, and lowest UniFrac distance values, the other haplotype reconstruction tools followed by CliqueSNV, which, given more computational time, may have outperformed PredictHaplo. Here, we present an extensive comparison of available viral haplotype reconstruction tools and provide insights for future improvements in haplotype reconstruction tools using both short-read and long-read technologies.",

abstract = "As Bayesian methods become more popular among behavioral scientists, they will inevitably be applied in situations that violate the assumptions underpinning typical models used to guide statistical inference. With this in mind, it is important to know something about how robust Bayesian methods are to the violation of those assumptions. In this paper, we focus on the problem of contaminated data (such as data with outliers or conflicts present), with specific application to the problem of estimating a credible interval for the population mean. We evaluate five Bayesian methods for constructing a credible interval, using toy examples to illustrate the qualitative behavior of different approaches in the presence of contaminants, and an extensive simulation study to quantify the robustness of each method. We find that the ``default'' normal model used in most Bayesian data analyses is not robust, and that approaches based on the Bayesian bootstrap are only robust in limited circumstances. A simple parametric model based on Tukey's ``contaminated normal model'' and a model based on the t-distribution were markedly more robust. However, the contaminated normal model had the added benefit of estimating which data points were discounted as outliers and which were not.",

abstract = "We discovered a highly virulent variant of subtype-B HIV-1 in the Netherlands. One hundred nine individuals with this variant had a 0.54 to 0.74 log10 increase (i.e., a ~3.5-fold to 5.5-fold increase) in viral load compared with, and exhibited CD4 cell decline twice as fast as, 6604 individuals with other subtype-B strains. Without treatment, advanced HIV-CD4 cell counts below 350 cells per cubic millimeter, with long-term clinical consequences-is expected to be reached, on average, 9 months after diagnosis for individuals in their thirties with this variant. Age, sex, suspected mode of transmission, and place of birth for the aforementioned 109 individuals were typical for HIV-positive people in the Netherlands, which suggests that the increased virulence is attributable to the viral strain. Genetic sequence analysis suggests that this variant arose in the 1990s from de novo mutation, not recombination, with increased transmissibility and an unfamiliar molecular mechanism of virulence.",

abstract = "Sustained, drug-free control of HIV-1 replication is naturally achieved in less than 0.5\% of infected individuals (here termed 'elite controllers'), despite the presence of a replication-competent viral reservoir1. Inducing such an ability to spontaneously maintain undetectable plasma viraemia is a major objective of HIV-1 cure research, but the characteristics of proviral reservoirs in elite controllers remain to be determined. Here, using next-generation sequencing of near-full-length single HIV-1 genomes and corresponding chromosomal integration sites, we show that the proviral reservoirs of elite controllers frequently consist of oligoclonal to near-monoclonal clusters of intact proviral sequences. In contrast to individuals treated with long-term antiretroviral therapy, intact proviral sequences from elite controllers were integrated at highly distinct sites in the human genome and were preferentially located in centromeric satellite DNA or in Kr{\"u}ppel-associated box domain-containing zinc finger genes on chromosome 19, both of which are associated with heterochromatin features. Moreover, the integration sites of intact proviral sequences from elite controllers showed an increased distance to transcriptional start sites and accessible chromatin of the host genome and were enriched in repressive chromatin marks. These data suggest that a distinct configuration of the proviral reservoir represents a structural correlate of natural viral control, and that the quality, rather than the quantity, of viral reservoirs can be an important distinguishing feature for a functional cure of HIV-1 infection. Moreover, in one elite controller, we were unable to detect intact proviral sequences despite analysing more than 1.5 billion peripheral blood mononuclear cells, which raises the possibility that a sterilizing cure of HIV-1 infection, which has previously been observed only following allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation2,3, may be feasible in rare instances.",

Here we sequenced and assembled the genome of a captive sooty mangabey. We conducted genome-wide comparative analyses of transcript assemblies from C. atys and AIDS-susceptible species, such as humans and macaques, to identify candidates for host genetic factors that influence susceptibility. We identified several immune-related genes in the genome of C. atys that show substantial sequence divergence from macaques or humans. One of these sequence divergences, a C-terminal frameshift in the toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) gene of C. atys, is associated with a blunted in vitro response to TLR-4 ligands. In addition, we found a major structural change in exons 3-4 of the immune-regulatory protein intercellular adhesion molecule 2 (ICAM-2); expression of this variant leads to reduced cell surface expression of ICAM-2.

We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2\% and 87.1\% of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space.

title = "An alignment method for nucleic acid sequences against annotated genomes",
author = "Deforche, Koen",
abstract = "Abstract Motivation Biological sequence alignment is fundamental to their further interpretation. Current alignment algorithms typically align either nucleic acid or amino acid sequences. Using only nucleic acid sequence similarity, divergent sequences cannot be aligned reliably because of the limited alphabet and genetic saturation. To align divergent coding nucleic acid sequences, one can align using the translated amino acid sequences. This requires the detection of the correct open reading frame, is prone to eventual frame shift errors, and typically requires the treatment of genes separately. It was our motivation to design a nucleic acid sequence alignment algorithm to align a nucleic acid sequence against a (reference) genome sequence, that works equally well for similar and divergent sequences, and produces an optimal alignment considering simultaneously the alignment of all annotated coding sequences.Results We define a genome alignment score for evaluating the quality of an alignment of a nucleic acid query sequence against a reference genome sequence, for which coding sequence features have been annotated (for example in a GenBank record). The genome alignment score combines the a ne gap score for the nucleic acid sequence with an a ne gap score for all amino acid alignments resulting from coding sequences in open reading frames contained within the query sequence. We present a Dynamic Programming algorithm to compute the optimal global or local alignment using this genomic alignment score and provide a formal proof of correctness. This algorithm allows the alignment of nucleic acid sequences from closely related and highly divergent sequences within the same software and using the same parameters, automatically correcting any eventual frame shift errors and produces at the same time the aligned translated amino acid sequences of all relevant coding sequence features.Availability The software is available as a web application at http://www.genomedetective.com/app/aga and as command-line application at https://github.com/emweb/aga",

The elimination of sequencing noise is a non-trivial task that still remains open. Here we propose CliqueSNV based on extracting pairs of statistically linked mutations from noisy reads. This effectively reduces sequencing noise and enables identifying minority haplotypes with the frequency below the sequencing error rate. We comparatively assess the performance of CliqueSNV using an in vitro mixture of nine haplotypes that were derived from the mutation profile of an existing HIV patient. We show that CliqueSNV can accurately assemble viral haplotypes with frequencies as low as 0.1\% and maintains consistent performance across short and long bases sequencing platforms.",

Surprisingly, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has apparently required little to no significant adaptation to humans since the start of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to October 2020. Here we assess the types of natural selection taking place in Sarbecoviruses in horseshoe bats versus the early SARS-CoV-2 evolution in humans. While there is moderate evidence of diversifying positive selection in SARS-CoV-2 in humans, it is limited to the early phase of the pandemic, and purifying selection is much weaker in SARS-CoV-2 than in related bat Sarbecoviruses. In contrast, our analysis detects evidence for significant positive episodic diversifying selection acting at the base of the bat virus lineage SARS-CoV-2 emerged from, accompanied by an adaptive depletion in CpG composition presumed to be linked to the action of antiviral mechanisms in these ancestral bat hosts. The closest bat virus to SARS-CoV-2, RmYN02 (sharing an ancestor about 1976), is a recombinant with a structure that includes differential CpG content in Spike; clear evidence of coinfection and evolution in bats without involvement of other species. While an undiscovered ``facilitating'' intermediate species cannot be discounted, collectively, our results support the progenitor of SARS-CoV-2 being capable of efficient human-human transmission as a consequence of its adaptive evolutionary history in bats, not humans, which created a relatively generalist virus.",

Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences.

abstract = "Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T immunotherapy has yielded impressive results in several B cell malignancies, establishing itself as a powerful means to redirect the natural properties of T lymphocytes. In this strategy, the T cell genome is modified by the integration of lentiviral vectors encoding CAR that direct tumor cell killing. However, this therapeutic approach is often limited by the extent of CAR-T cell expansion in vivo. A major outstanding question is whether or not CAR-T integration itself enhances the proliferative competence of individual T cells by rewiring their regulatory landscape. To address this question, it is critical to define the identity of an individual CAR-T cell and simultaneously chart where the CAR-T vector integrates into the genome. Here, we report the development of a method called EpiVIA (https://github.com/VahediLab/epiVIA) for the joint profiling of the chromatin accessibility and lentiviral integration site analysis at the population and single-cell levels. We validate our technique in clonal cells with previously defined integration sites and further demonstrate the ability to measure lentiviral integration sites and chromatin accessibility of host and viral genomes at the single-cell resolution in CAR-T cells. We anticipate that EpiVIA will enable the single-cell deconstruction of gene regulation during CAR-T therapy, leading to the discovery of cellular factors associated with durable treatment.",

abstract = "Chromatin accessibility, or the physical access to chromatinized DNA, is a widely studied characteristic of the eukaryotic genome. As active regulatory DNA elements are generally `accessible', the genome-wide profiling of chromatin accessibility can be used to identify candidate regulatory genomic regions in a tissue or cell type. Multiple biochemical methods have been developed to profile chromatin accessibility, both in bulk and at the single-cell level. Depending on the method, enzymatic cleavage, transposition or DNA methyltransferases are used, followed by high-throughput sequencing, providing a view of genome-wide chromatin accessibility. In this Primer, we discuss these biochemical methods, as well as bioinformatics tools for analysing and interpreting the generated data, and insights into the key regulators underlying developmental, evolutionary and disease processes. We outline standards for data quality, reproducibility and deposition used by the genomics community. Although chromatin accessibility profiling is invaluable to study gene regulation, alone it provides only a partial view of this complex process. Orthogonal assays facilitate the interpretation of accessible regions with respect to enhancer--promoter proximity, functional transcription factor binding and regulatory function. We envision that technological improvements including single-molecule, multi-omics and spatial methods will bring further insight into the secrets of genome regulation. This Primer on chromatin accessibility profiling methods discusses differences in the methods commonly used to determine chromatin states in different cell types, including ATAC-seq and ChIP--seq.

Conventional T cells showed no widespread activation or helper T cell bias, but a monomorphic disease signature affected all CD4+ T cells. This signature proved to be cell extrinsic since it was extinguished in mixed bone marrow chimeric mice and heterozygous mothers of patients with IPEX syndrome. Normal Treg cells exerted dominant suppression, quenching the disease signature and revealing in mutant Treg-like cells a small cluster of genes regulated cell-intrinsically by FOXP3, including key homeostatic regulators. We propose a two-step pathogenesis model: cell-intrinsic downregulation of core FOXP3-dependent genes destabilizes Treg cells, de-repressing systemic mediators that imprint the disease signature on all T cells, furthering Treg cell dysfunction. Accordingly, interleukin-2 treatment improved the Treg-like compartment and survival.",

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.",

Originally identified as a B-cell chemoattractant, CXCL13 exerts important functions in lymphoid neogenesis, and has been widely implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of autoimmune diseases and inflammatory conditions, as well as in lymphoproliferative disorders. Current evidence also indicates that the CXCL13:CXCR5 axis orchestrates cell-cell interactions that regulate lymphocyte infiltration within the tumor microenvironment, thereby determining responsiveness to cytotoxic and immune-targeted therapies. In this review, we provide a comprehensive perspective of the involvement of CXCL13 and its receptor in cancer progression. Studies in recent years postulated novel roles for this chemokine in controlling the cancer cell phenotype, and suggest important functions in the growth and metastatic dissemination of solid tumors. Carcinogens have been found to induce CXCL13 production, and production of this chemokine within the tumor milieu has been shown to impact the proliferation, migration, and invasive properties of cancer cells. Thus, the complex networks of cellular interactions involving tumoral CXCL13 and CXCR5 integrate to promote cancer cell autonomous and non-autonomous responses, highlighting the relevance of autocrine and paracrine interactions in dictating the cancer phenotype. Dissecting the molecular and signaling events regulated by CXCL13 and how this chemokine dynamically controls the interaction between the cancer cell and the tumor microenvironment is key to identify novel effectors and therapeutic targets for cancer treatment.",

Retroviral integration has far-reaching consequences, from perpetuating deadly human diseases to molding metazoan evolution. The lentivirus human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), which is the causative agent of the AIDS pandemic, efficiently infects interphase cells due to the active nuclear import of its preintegration complex (PIC). To enable integration, the PIC must navigate the densely-packed nuclear environment where the genome is organized into different chromatin states of varying accessibility in accordance with cellular needs. The HIV-1 capsid protein interacts with specific host factors to facilitate PIC nuclear import, while additional interactions of viral integrase, the enzyme responsible for viral DNA integration, with cellular nuclear proteins and nucleobases guide integration to specific chromosomal sites. HIV-1 integration favors transcriptionally active chromatin such as speckle-associated domains and disfavors heterochromatin including lamina-associated domains. In this review, we describe virus-host interactions that facilitate HIV-1 PIC nuclear import and integration site targeting, highlighting commonalities among factors that participate in both of these steps. We moreover discuss how the nuclear landscape influences HIV-1 integration site selection as well as the establishment of active versus latent virus infection.",

Prior work has demonstrated that signals present in the inflamed tissue micro-environment can promote the differentiation of memory precursor cells into mature TRM cells, and it was therefore long assumed that TRM cell formation adheres to a `local divergence' model, in which TRM cell lineage decisions are exclusively made within the tissue. However, a growing body of work provides evidence for a `systemic divergence' model, in which circulating T cells already become preconditioned to preferentially give rise to the TRM cell lineage, resulting in the generation of a pool of TRM cell-poised T cells within the lymphoid compartment. Here, we review the emerging evidence that supports the existence of such a population of circulating TRM cell progenitors, discuss current insights into their formation and highlight open questions in the field. CD8+ tissue resident memory T cells (TRM cells) are essential for defence against pathogens and malignancies. Prior work had indicated that these cells form within inflamed tissue, but there is emerging evidence that a pool of TRM cell precursors exists within the circulation. This Review examines the processes and signals within the lymphoid compartment that determine lineage decisions towards the formation of TRM cells.",

abstract = "BCL6 encodes a transcriptional repressor that is essential for the germinal center (GC) reaction and important in lymphomagenesis. Although its promoter has been well studied, little is known concerning its possible regulation by more distal elements. To gain such information, we mapped critical histone modifications associated with active transcription within BCL6 as well as far upstream sequences at nucleosomal resolution in B-cell lines and in normal naive and GC B cells. Promoter-associated and intronic CpG islands (CGIs) in BCL6 showed a reciprocal pattern of histone modifications. Gene expression correlated with a paradoxical loss from the intronic CGI of histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation, normally associated with transcription, suggesting that the intronic CGI may interfere with transcription. In an approximately 110-kb region extending 150-260 kb upstream of BCL6, highly active histone modifications were present only in normal GC B cells and a GC B-cell line; this region overlaps with an alternative breakpoint region for chromosomal translocations and contains a GC-specific noncoding RNA gene. By chromosome conformation capture, we determined that the BCL6 promoter interacts with this distant upstream region. It is likely that transcriptional enhancers in this region activate BCL6 and overcome strong autorepression in GC B cells.",

To address this question, we compared proportions and functions of various B-cell subsets and follicular helper T-cells (TFH) in untreated (Placebo) and BR3-Fc treated (Treated) SIV-infected macaques. From day 2 post-infection (dpi), Treated macaques received one weekly injection of BR3-Fc molecule, a soluble BAFF antagonist, for 4 weeks. Whereas, the kinetics of CD4+ T-cell loss and plasma viral loads were comparable in both groups, BAFF blockade delayed the peak of inflammatory cytokines (CXCL10, IFN$\alpha$), impaired the renewal of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and fostered the decline of plasma CXCL13 titers after 14 dpi. In Treated macaques, proportions of total and na{\"\i}ve B-cells were reduced in blood and spleen whereas SIV-induced loss of marginal zone (MZ) B-cells was only accentuated in blood and terminal ileum. Proportions of spleen GC B-cells and TFH were similar in both groups, with CD8+ T-cells and rare Foxp3+ being present in spleen GC. Regardless of treatment, sorted TFH produced similar levels of IL21, CXCL13, and IFN$\gamma$ but no IL2, IL4, or BAFF and exhibited similar capacities to support IgG production by autologous or heterologous B-cells. Consistently, most TFH were negative for BAFF-R and TACI. Higher proportions of resting and atypical (CD21lo) memory B-cells were present in Treated macaques compared to Placebo. In both groups, we found higher levels of BAFF-R expression on MZ and resting memory B-cells but low levels on atypical memory B-cells. TACI was present on 20-30\% of MZ, resting and atypical memory B-cells in Placebo macaques. BAFF blockade decreased TACI expression on these B-cell subsets as well as titers of SIV-specific and vaccine-specific antibodies arguing for BAFF being mandatory for plasma cell survival. Irrespective of treatment, GC B-cells expressed BAFF-R at low level and were negative for TACI. In addition to key information on spleen BAFF-R and TACI expression, our data argue for BAFF contributing to the GC reaction in terminal ileum but being dispensable for the generation of atypical memory B-cells and GC reaction in spleen during T-dependent response against SIV.",

Additionally, the Vero cell line has shown a high affinity for infection by MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and recently SARS-CoV-2, emerging as an important discovery and screening tool to support the global research and development efforts in this COVID-19 pandemic. However, the lack of a reference genome for the Vero cell line has limited our understanding of host-virus interactions underlying such affinity of the Vero cell towards key emerging pathogens, and more importantly our ability to redesign high-yield vaccine production processes using Vero genome editing. In this paper, we present an annotated highly contiguous 2.9 Gb assembly of the Vero cell genome. In addition, several viral genome insertions, including Adeno-associated virus serotypes 3, 4, 7, and 8, have been identified, giving valuable insights into quality control considerations for cell-based vaccine production systems. Variant calling revealed that, in addition to interferon, chemokines, and caspases-related genes lost their functions.

To answer the second question, I then survey two common uses of underdetermination in broader arguments against scientific realism and in support of the use of values in scientific theory choice. I conclude that philosophers should also care about underdetermination because it impacts scientists in their practice.",

To characterize within-host diversity and transmission, we deep-sequenced 1313 clinical samples from the United Kingdom. SARS-CoV-2 infections are characterized by low levels of within-host diversity when viral loads are high and by a narrow bottleneck at transmission. Most variants are either lost or occasionally fixed at the point of transmission, with minimal persistence of shared diversity, patterns that are readily observable on the phylogenetic tree. Our results suggest that transmission-enhancing and/or immune-escape SARS-CoV-2 variants are likely to arise infrequently but could spread rapidly if successfully transmitted.",

Moreover, it has been recently found to demethylate monomethylated and dimethylated lysine 20 in histone H4 and to contribute to the balance of several other methylated lysine residues in histone H3 (i.e., H3K27, H3K36, and H3K79). Furthermore, in recent years, a plethora of nonhistone proteins have been detected as targets of LSD1 activity, suggesting that this demethylase is a fundamental player in the regulation of multiple pathways triggered in several cellular processes, including cancer progression. In this review, we analyze the molecular mechanism by which LSD1 displays its dual effect on gene expression (related to the specific lysine target), placing final emphasis on the use of pharmacological inhibitors of its activity in future clinical studies to fight cancer.",

abstract = "Co-transcriptional methylations of histone H3 at lysines 4 and 36, highly conserved methyl marks from yeast to humans, have profound roles in regulation of histone acetylation. These modifications function to recruit and/or activate distinct histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs). Whereas H3K4me3 increases acetylation at promoters via multiple HATs, H3K4me2 targets Set3 HDAC to deacetylate histones in 5' transcribed regions. In 3' regions of genes, H3K36me2/3 facilitates deacetylation by Rpd3S HDAC and slows elongation. Despite their important functions in deacetylation, no strong effects on global gene expression have been seen under optimized or laboratory growth conditions. Instead, H3K4me2-Set3 HDAC and Set2-Rpd3S pathways primarily delay the kinetics of messenger RNA (mRNA) and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) induction upon environmental changes. A majority of mRNA genes regulated by these pathways have an overlapping lncRNA transcription either from an upstream or an antisense promoter. Surprisingly, the distance between mRNA and lncRNA promoters seems to specify the repressive effects of the two pathways. Given that co-transcriptional methylations and acetylation have been linked to many cancers, studying their functions in a dynamic condition or during cancer progression will be much more important and help identify novel genes associated with cancers.",

These events ultimately promote malignancy through disruption of normal gene regulation and development.

Lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1) is a critical functional partner for EWS/FLI as inhibition of LSD1 reverses the transcriptional activity of EWS/FLI. However, how LSD1 participates in fusion-directed epigenomic regulation and aberrant gene activation is unknown. We now show EWS/FLI causes dynamic rearrangement of LSD1 and we uncover a role for LSD1 in gene activation through colocalization at EWS/FLI binding sites throughout the genome. LSD1 is integral to the establishment of Ewing sarcoma super-enhancers at GGAA-microsatellites, which ubiquitously overlap non-microsatellite loci bound by EWS/FLI.

Understanding whether severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or vaccination elicits a GC response has profound implications for the capacity of responding B cells to contribute to protection against infection. However, direct assessment of the GC response in humans remains a major challenge. Here we summarize emerging evidence for the importance of the GC response in the establishment of durable and broad immunity against SARS-CoV-2 and discuss new approaches to modulate the GC response to better protect against newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. We also discuss new findings showing that the GC B cell response persists in the draining lymph nodes for at least 6 months in some individuals following vaccination with SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-based vaccines.

They also consider the germinal centre responses seen following vaccination and how germinal centre responses may be modulated to induce broad protection against new variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

abstract = "High-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing is a powerful technique but only generates short reads from one end of a cDNA template, limiting the reconstruction of highly diverse sequences such as antigen receptors. To overcome this limitation, we combined targeted capture and long-read sequencing of T-cell-receptor (TCR) and B-cell-receptor (BCR) mRNA transcripts with short-read transcriptome profiling of barcoded single-cell libraries generated by droplet-based partitioning. We show that Repertoire and Gene Expression by Sequencing (RAGE-Seq) can generate accurate full-length antigen receptor sequences at nucleotide resolution, infer B-cell clonal evolution and identify alternatively spliced BCR transcripts. We apply RAGE-Seq to 7138 cells sampled from the primary tumor and draining lymph node of a breast cancer patient to track transcriptome profiles of expanded lymphocyte clones across tissues. Our results demonstrate that RAGE-Seq is a powerful method for tracking the clonal evolution from large numbers of lymphocytes applicable to the study of immunity, autoimmunity and cancer.",

VitD then initiated the transition from pro-inflammatory interferon-$\gamma$+ TH1 cells to suppressive interleukin-10+ cells. This process was primed by dynamic changes in the epigenetic landscape of CD4+ T cells, generating super-enhancers and recruiting several transcription factors, notably c-JUN, STAT3 and BACH2, which together with VitD receptor shaped the transcriptional response to VitD. Accordingly, VitD did not induce interleukin-10 expression in cells with dysfunctional BACH2 or STAT3. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid CD4+ T cells of patients with COVID-19 were TH1-skewed and showed de-repression of genes downregulated by VitD, from either lack of substrate (VitD deficiency) and/or abnormal regulation of this system.",

However, in human lymph nodes (LNs), only a small subset of CD8+ T-cells expresses CXCR5, the chemokine receptor required for cell migration into B cell follicles, which are major sanctuaries for HIV persistence in individuals on therapy. Here, we investigate the impact of HIV infection on follicular CD8+ T-cells (fCD8s) frequencies, trafficking pattern and CXCR5 regulation. We show that, although HIV infection results in a marginal increase of fCD8s in LN, the majority of HIV-specific CD8+ T-cells are CXCR5 negative (non-fCD8s) (p<0.003). Mechanistic investigations using ATAC-seq showed that non-fCD8s have closed chromatin at the CXCR5 transcriptional start site (TSS). DNA bisulfite sequencing identified DNA hypermethylation at the CXCR5 TSS as the most probable cause of closed chromatin. Transcriptional factor footprints analysis revealed enrichment of transforming growth factors (TGFs) at the TSS of fCD8s. In-vitro stimulation of non-fCD8s with recombinant TGF-$\beta$ resulted in significant increase in CXCR5 expression (fCD8s). Thus, this study identifies TGF-$\beta$ signaling as a viable strategy for increasing fCD8s frequencies in follicular areas of the LN where they are needed to eliminate HIV infected cells, with implications for HIV cure strategies.",

abstract = "DNA methylation profiling offers unique insights into human development and diseases. Often the analysis of complex tissues and cell mixtures is the only feasible option to study methylation changes across large patient cohorts. Since DNA methylomes are highly cell type specific, deconvolution methods can be used to recover cell type-specific information in the form of latent methylation components (LMCs) from such 'bulk' samples. Reference-free deconvolution methods retrieve these components without the need for DNA methylation profiles of purified cell types. Currently no integrated and guided procedure is available for data preparation and subsequent interpretation of deconvolution results. Here, we describe a three-stage protocol for reference-free deconvolution of DNA methylation data comprising: (i) data preprocessing, confounder adjustment using independent component analysis (ICA) and feature selection using DecompPipeline, (ii) deconvolution with multiple parameters using MeDeCom, RefFreeCellMix or EDec and (iii) guided biological inference and validation of deconvolution results with the R/Shiny graphical user interface FactorViz. Our protocol simplifies the analysis and guides the initial interpretation of DNA methylation data derived from complex samples. The harmonized approach is particularly useful to dissect and evaluate cell heterogeneity in complex systems such as tumors. We apply the protocol to lung cancer methylomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and show that our approach identifies the proportions of stromal cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells, as well as associations of the detected components with clinical parameters.

abstract = "Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given an arbitrary tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints, limiting (1) the diameter of each cluster, (2) the sum of its branch lengths, or (3) chains of pairwise distances. These three problems can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, and for two of the three criteria, the algorithms have been known in the theoretical computer scientist literature. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU clustering for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications.

abstract = "Crosstalk between T and B cells is crucial for generating high-affinity, class-switched antibody responses. The roles of CD4+ T cells in this process have been well-characterised. In contrast, regulation of antibody responses by CD8+ T cells is significantly less defined. CD8+ T cells are principally recognised for eliciting cytotoxic responses in peripheral tissues and forming protective memory. However, recent findings have identified a novel population of effector CD8+ T cells that co-opt a differentiation program characteristic of CD4+ T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, upregulate the chemokine receptor CXCR5 and localise to B cell follicles. While it has been shown that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells mediate the removal of viral reservoirs in the context of follicular-trophic viral infections and maintain the response to chronic insults by virtue of progenitor/stem-like properties, it is not known if CXCR5+CD8+ T cells arise during acute peripheral challenges in the absence of follicular infection and whether they influence B cell responses in vivo in these settings. Using the ovalbumin-specific T cell receptor transgenic (OT-I) system in an adoptive transfer-immunisation/infection model, this study demonstrates that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells arise in response to protein immunisation and peripheral viral infection, displaying a follicular-homing phenotype, expression of cell surface molecules associated with Tfh cells and limited cytotoxic potential. Furthermore, studies assessing the B cell response in the presence of OT-I or Cxcr5-/- OT-I cells revealed that CXCR5+CD8+ T cells shape the antibody response to protein immunisation and peripheral viral infection, promoting class switching to IgG2c in responding B cells. Overall, the results highlight a novel contribution of CD8+ T cells to antibody responses, expanding the functionality of the adaptive immune system.",

We used CRISPR-mediated deletion to create bi-allelic knockouts of ZFX and/or ZNF711 in female HEK293T cells (which naturally lack ZFY). We found that loss of either ZFX or ZNF711 reduced cell growth and that the double knockout cells have major defects in proliferation. RNA-seq analysis revealed that thousands of genes showed altered expression in the double knockout clones, suggesting that these TFs are critical regulators of the transcriptome. To gain insight into how these TFs regulate transcription, we created mutant ZFX proteins and analyzed them for DNA binding and transactivation capability. We found that zinc fingers 11-13 are necessary and sufficient for DNA binding and, in combination with the N terminal region, constitute a functional transactivator.

abstract = "Chromosome structure in mammals is thought to regulate transcription by modulating three-dimensional interactions between enhancers and promoters, notably through CTCF-mediated loops and topologically associating domains (TADs)1--4. However, how chromosome interactions are actually translated into transcriptional outputs remains unclear. Here, to address this question, we use an assay to position an enhancer at large numbers of densely spaced chromosomal locations relative to a fixed promoter, and measure promoter output and interactions within a genomic region with minimal regulatory and structural complexity. A quantitative analysis of hundreds of cell lines reveals that the transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship. Mathematical modelling suggests that nonlinearity might arise from transient enhancer--promoter interactions being translated into slower promoter bursting dynamics in individual cells, therefore uncoupling the temporal dynamics of interactions from those of transcription. This uncovers a potential mechanism of how distal enhancers act from large genomic distances, and of how topologically associating domain boundaries block distal enhancers. Finally, we show that enhancer strength also determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation. Our measurements establish general principles for the context-dependent role of chromosome structure in long-range transcriptional regulation. The transcriptional effect of an enhancer depends on its contact probabilities with the promoter through a nonlinear relationship, and enhancer strength determines absolute transcription levels as well as the sensitivity of a promoter to CTCF-mediated transcriptional insulation.",

abstract = "T and B cells express most cholinergic system components-e.g., acetylcholine (ACh), choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), acetylcholinesterase, and both muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively). Using ChATBAC-eGFP transgenic mice, ChAT expression has been confirmed in T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. Moreover, T cell activation via T-cell receptor/CD3-mediated pathways upregulates ChAT mRNA expression and ACh synthesis, suggesting that this lymphocytic cholinergic system contributes to the regulation of immune function. Immune cells express all five mAChRs (M1-M5). Combined M1/M5 mAChR-deficient (M1/M5-KO) mice produce less antigen-specific antibody than wild-type (WT) mice. Furthermore, spleen cells in M1/M5-KO mice produce less tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$ and interleukin (IL)-6, suggesting M1/M5 mAChRs are involved in regulating pro-inflammatory cytokine and antibody production. Immune cells also frequently express the $\alpha$2, $\alpha$5, $\alpha$6, $\alpha$7, $\alpha$9, and $\alpha$10 nAChR subunits. $\alpha$7 nAChR-deficient ($\alpha$7-KO) mice produce more antigen-specific antibody than WT mice, and spleen cells from $\alpha$7-KO mice produce more TNF-$\alpha$ and IL-6 than WT cells. This suggests that $\alpha$7 nAChRs are involved in regulating cytokine production and thus modulate antibody production. Evidence also indicates that nicotine modulates immune responses by altering cytokine production and that $\alpha$7 nAChR signaling contributes to immunomodulation through modification of T cell differentiation. Together, these findings suggest the involvement of both mAChRs and nAChRs in the regulation of immune function. The observation that vagus nerve stimulation protects mice from lethal endotoxin shock led to the notion of a cholinergic anti-inflammatory reflex pathway, and the spleen is an essential component of this anti-inflammatory reflex. Because the spleen lacks direct vagus innervation, it has been postulated that ACh synthesized by a subset of CD4+ T cells relays vagal nerve signals to $\alpha$7 nAChRs on splenic macrophages, which downregulates TNF-$\alpha$ synthesis and release, thereby modulating inflammatory responses. However, because the spleen is innervated solely by the noradrenergic splenic nerve, confirmation of an anti-inflammatory reflex pathway involving the spleen requires several more hypotheses to be addressed. We will review and discuss these issues in the context of the cholinergic system in immune cells.",

Here, we demonstrate that histone demethylase LSD1 acts to enforce an epigenetic program in progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells to antagonize the TCF1-mediated progenitor maintenance and to promote terminal differentiation. Consequently, genetic perturbation or small molecules targeting LSD1 increases the persistence of the progenitor exhausted CD8+ T cells, which provide a sustained source for the proliferative conversion to numerically larger terminally exhausted T cells with tumor-killing cytotoxicity, thereby leading to effective and durable responses to anti-PD1 therapy. Collectively, our findings provide important insights into epigenetic mechanisms that regulate T cell exhaustion and have important implications for durable immunotherapy.",

abstract = "The inhibitory immune receptor programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) is intricately regulated. In T cells, PD-1 is expressed in response to most immune challenges, but it is rapidly downregulated in acute settings, allowing for normal immune responses. On chronically stimulated Ag-specific T cells, PD-1 expression remains high, leading to an impaired response to stimuli. Ab blockade of PD-1 interactions during chronic Ag settings partially restores immune function and is now used clinically to treat a variety of devastating cancers. Understanding the regulation of PD-1 expression may be useful for developing novel immune-based therapies. In this review, the molecular mechanisms that drive dynamic PD-1 expression during acute and chronic antigenic stimuli are discussed. An array of cis-DNA elements, transcription factors, and epigenetic components, including DNA methylation and histone modifications, control PD-1 expression. The interplay between these regulators fine-tunes PD-1 expression in different inflammatory environments and across numerous cell types to modulate immune responses.",

Phosphorylation by PKC is important in regulating a variety of cellular events such as cell proliferation and the regulation of gene expression. In the immune system, PKCs are involved in regulating signal transduction pathways important for both innate and adaptive immunity, ultimately resulting in the expression of key immune genes. PKCs act as mediators during immune cell signalling through the immunological synapse. PKCs are traditionally known to be cytoplasmic signal transducers and are well embedded in the signalling pathways of cells to mediate the cells' response to a stimulus from the plasma membrane to the nucleus. PKCs are also found to transduce signals within the nucleus, a process that is distinct from the cytoplasmic signalling pathway. There is now growing evidence suggesting that PKC can directly regulate gene expression programmes through a non-traditional role as nuclear kinases. In this review, we will focus on the role of PKCs as key cytoplasmic signal transducers in immune cell signalling, as well as its role in nuclear signal transduction. We will also highlight recent evidence for its newly discovered regulatory role in the nucleus as a chromatin-associated kinase.",

Here, we targeted epigenetic regulators in a pharmacological screen and discovered that the lysine-specific histone demethylase 1A (LSD1/KDM1A) is required for MCC growth in vitro and in vivo. We show that LSD1 inhibition in MCC disrupts the LSD1-CoREST complex leading to displacement and degradation of HMG20B (BRAF35), a poorly characterized complex member that is essential for MCC proliferation. Inhibition of LSD1 causes derepression of transcriptional master regulators of the neuronal lineage, activates a gene expression signature resembling normal Merkel cells, and induces cell cycle arrest and cell death. Our study unveils the importance of LSD1 for maintaining cellular plasticity and proliferation in MCC. There is also growing evidence that cancer cells exploit cellular plasticity and dedifferentiation programs to evade destruction by the immune system.

Although Bcl6 has been shown to be essential in TFH-cell function, it may not regulate the initial migration of T cells or the induction of the TFH program, as exemplified by C-X-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CXCR5) upregulation. Here we show that expression of achaete-scute homologue 2 (Ascl2)--a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor--is selectively upregulated in TFH cells. Ectopic expression of Ascl2 upregulates CXCR5 but not Bcl6, and downregulates C-C chemokine receptor 7 (CCR7) expression in T cells in vitro, as well as accelerating T-cell migration to the follicles and TFH-cell development in vivo in mice. Genome-wide analysis indicates that Ascl2 directly regulates TFH-related genes whereas it inhibits expression of T-helper cell 1 (TH1) and TH17 signature genes. Acute deletion of Ascl2, as well as blockade of its function with the Id3 protein in CD4(+) T cells, results in impaired TFH-cell development and germinal centre response. Conversely, mutation of Id3, known to cause antibody-mediated autoimmunity, greatly enhances TFH-cell generation. Thus, Ascl2 directly initiates TFH-cell development.",

RESULTS: Paired excisional LN and peripheral blood samples obtained from 20 HIV-uninfected and 31 HIV-infected treated and 7 chronic untreated, were used to determine if and how HIV infection modulate frequencies, function and spatial localization of TFRs within LN tissues. Imaging studies showed that most TFRs are localized in extra-follicular regions. Co-culture assays showed TFRs suppression of TFH help to B cells. Importantly, epigenetic and transcriptional studies identified DPP4 and FCRL3 as novel phenotypic markers that define four functionally distinct TFR subpopulations in human LNs regardless of HIV status. Imaging studies confirmed the regulatory phenotype of DPP4+TFRs. CONCLUSION: Together these studies describe TFRs dynamic changes during HIV infection and reveal previously underappreciated TFR heterogeneity within human LNs.",

This transition involves changes in histone methylation and one of the key regulators of this is the H3K4me2/1 histone demethylase LSD1. Here, we show that the highest expression of LSD1 occurs in postmitotic retinal cells during the peak period of rod photoreceptor differentiation. Pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 in retinal explants cultured from PN1 to PN8 had three major effects. It prevented the normal decrease in expression of genes associated with progenitor function, it blocked rod photoreceptor development, and it increased expression of genes associated with other retinal cell types. The maintained expression of progenitor genes was associated with a maintained level of H3K4me2 over the gene and its promoter. Among the genes whose expression was maintained was Hes1, a repressor known to block rod photoreceptor development. The inhibition of rod photoreceptor gene expression occurred in spite of the normal expression of transcription factors CRX and NRL, and the normal accumulation of H3K4me2 marks over the promoter and gene body. We suggest that LSD1 acts in concert with a series of nuclear receptors to modify chromatin structure and repress progenitor genes as well as to inhibit ectopic patterns of gene expression in the differentiating postmitotic retinal cells.",

abstract = "BackgroundSequence alignment data is often ordered by coordinate (id of the reference sequence plus position on the sequence where the fragment was mapped) when stored in BAM files, as this simplifies the extraction of variants between the mapped data and the reference or of variants within the mapped data. In this order paired reads are usually separated in the file, which complicates some other applications like duplicate marking or conversion to the FastQ format which require to access the full information of the pairs.ResultsIn this paper we introduce biobambam, a set of tools based on the efficient collation of alignments in BAM files by read name. The employed collation algorithm avoids time and space consuming sorting of alignments by read name where this is possible without using more than a specified amount of main memory. Using this algorithm tasks like duplicate marking in BAM files and conversion of BAM files to the FastQ format can be performed very efficiently with limited resources. We also make the collation algorithm available in the form of an API for other projects. This API is part of the libmaus package.ConclusionsIn comparison with previous approaches to problems involving the collation of alignments by read name like the BAM to FastQ or duplication marking utilities our approach can often perform an equivalent task more efficiently in terms of the required main memory and run-time. Our BAM to FastQ conversion is faster than all widely known alternatives including Picard and bamUtil. Our duplicate marking is about as fast as the closest competitor bamUtil for small data sets and faster than all known alternatives on large and complex data sets.",

A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format.

Many targets of PARP-1/2-dependent PARylation are involved in the DNA damage response and hence, the loss of these proteins disrupts a wide range of biological processes, from DNA repair and epigenetics to telomere and centromere regulation. The central role of these PARPs in DNA metabolism in cancer cells has led to the development of PARP inhibitors as new cancer therapeutics, both as adjuvant treatment potentiating chemo-, radio-, and immuno-therapies and as monotherapy exploiting cancer-specific defects in DNA repair. However, a cancer is not just made up of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment also includes multiple other cell types, particularly stromal and immune cells. Interactions between these cells-cancerous and non-cancerous-are known to either favor or limit tumorigenesis. In recent years, an important role of PARP-1 and PARP-2 has been demonstrated in different aspects of the immune response, modulating both the innate and adaptive immune system. It is now emerging that PARP-1 and PARP-2 may not only impact cancer cell biology, but also modulate the anti-tumor immune response. Understanding the immunomodulatory roles of PARP-1 and PARP-2 may provide invaluable clues to the rational development of more selective PARP-centered therapies which target both the cancer and its microenvironment.",

Using next-generation sequencing and in silico haplotype reconstruction, we analyzed whole-genome sequences from longitudinal plasma samples of eight chronically infected HIV-1-positive individuals failing 2nd-line regimens from the French National Agency for AIDS and Viral Hepatitis Research (ANRS) 12249 Treatment as Prevention (TasP) trial. On nonsuppressive ART, there were large fluctuations in synonymous and nonsynonymous variant frequencies despite stable viremia. Reconstructed haplotypes provided evidence for selective sweeps during periods of partial adherence, and viral haplotype competition, during periods of low drug exposure. Drug resistance mutations in reverse transcriptase (RT) were used as markers of viral haplotypes in the reservoir, and their distribution over time indicated recombination. We independently observed linkage disequilibrium decay, indicative of recombination. These data highlight dramatic changes in virus population structure that occur during stable viremia under nonsuppressive ART. IMPORTANCE HIV-1 infections are most commonly initiated with a single founder virus and are characterized by extensive inter- and intraparticipant genetic diversity. However, existing literature on HIV-1 intrahost population dynamics is largely limited to untreated infections, predominantly in subtype B-infected individuals. The manuscript characterizes viral population dynamics in long-term viremic treatment-experienced individuals, which has not been previously characterized. These data are particularly relevant for understanding HIV dynamics but can also be applied to other RNA viruses.

abstract = "AbstractCytosine base editors (CBEs) are larger and can suffer from higher off-target activity or lower on-target editing efficiency than current adenine base editors (ABEs). To develop a CBE that retains the small size, low off-target activity and high on-target activity of current ABEs, we evolved the highly active deoxyadenosine deaminase TadA-8e to perform cytidine deamination using phage-assisted continuous evolution. Evolved TadA cytidine deaminases contain mutations at DNA-binding residues that alter enzyme selectivity to strongly favor deoxycytidine over deoxyadenosine deamination. Compared to commonly used CBEs, TadA-derived cytosine base editors (TadCBEs) offer similar or higher on-target activity, smaller size and substantially lower Cas-independent DNA and RNA off-target editing activity. We also identified a TadA dual base editor (TadDE) that performs equally efficient cytosine and adenine base editing. TadCBEs support single or multiplexed base editing at therapeutically relevant genomic loci in primary human T cells and primary human hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. TadCBEs expand the utility of CBEs for precision gene editing.",

abstract = "Machine learning is frequently being leveraged to tackle problems in the health sector including utilization for clinical decision-support. Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEEXplore from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, FDA-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4\% in predictive accuracy. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation.",

abstract = "AbstractContinuous-time neural networks are a class of machine learning systems that can tackle representation learning on spatiotemporal decision-making tasks. These models are typically represented by continuous differential equations. However, their expressive power when they are deployed on computers is bottlenecked by numerical differential equation solvers. This limitation has notably slowed down the scaling and understanding of numerous natural physical phenomena such as the dynamics of nervous systems. Ideally, we would circumvent this bottleneck by solving the given dynamical system in closed form. This is known to be intractable in general. Here, we show that it is possible to closely approximate the interaction between neurons and synapses---the building blocks of natural and artificial neural networks---constructed by liquid time-constant networks efficiently in closed form. To this end, we compute a tightly bounded approximation of the solution of an integral appearing in liquid time-constant dynamics that has had no known closed-form solution so far. This closed-form solution impacts the design of continuous-time and continuous-depth neural models. For instance, since time appears explicitly in closed form, the formulation relaxes the need for complex numerical solvers. Consequently, we obtain models that are between one and five orders of magnitude faster in training and inference compared with differential equation-based counterparts. More importantly, in contrast to ordinary differential equation-based continuous networks, closed-form networks can scale remarkably well compared with other deep learning instances. Lastly, as these models are derived from liquid networks, they show good performance in time-series modelling compared with advanced recurrent neural network models.",

Our method utilizes artificial genotypes as negative controls and is equally valid for quantitative and binary phenotypes, without requiring any assumptions about their genetic architectures. Instead, we rely on well-established genetic models of linkage disequilibrium. We demonstrate that our method can detect more associations than mixed effects models and achieve fine-mapping precision, at comparable computational cost.

With advances in mass-spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics, 90,000 sites of serine and threonine phosphorylation have so far been identified, and several thousand have been associated with human diseases and biological processes3,4. For the vast majority of phosphorylation events, it is not yet known which of the more than 300 protein serine/threonine (Ser/Thr) kinases encoded in the human genome are responsible3. Here we used synthetic peptide libraries to profile the substrate sequence specificity of 303 Ser/Thr kinases, comprising more than 84\% of those predicted to be active in humans. Viewed in its entirety, the substrate specificity of the kinome was substantially more diverse than expected and was driven extensively by negative selectivity. We used our kinome-wide dataset to computationally annotate and identify the kinases capable of phosphorylating every reported phosphorylation site in the human Ser/Thr phosphoproteome. For the small minority of phosphosites for which the putative protein kinases involved have been previously reported, our predictions were in excellent agreement. When this approach was applied to examine the signalling response of tissues and cell lines to hormones, growth factors, targeted inhibitors and environmental or genetic perturbations, it revealed unexpected insights into pathway complexity and compensation. Overall, these studies reveal the intrinsic substrate specificity of the human Ser/Thr kinome, illuminate cellular signalling responses and provide a resource to link phosphorylation events to biological pathways. Analysis of the kinase activity of 300 protein Ser/Thr kinases reveals that the substrate specificity of the kinome is substantially more diverse than expected and is driven extensively by negative selectivity",

We analyzed HLA-associated HIV-1 subtype B polymorphisms in 1,888 treatment-na{\"\i}ve, chronically infected individuals using phylogenetically informed methods and identified characteristics of HLA-associated immune pressures that differentiate protective and nonprotective alleles. Over 2,100 HLA-associated HIV-1 polymorphisms were identified, approximately one-third of which occurred inside or within 3 residues of an optimally defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope. Differential CTL escape patterns between closely related HLA alleles were common and increased with greater evolutionary distance between allele group members. Among 9-mer epitopes, mutations at HLA-specific anchor residues represented the most frequently detected escape type: these occurred nearly 2-fold more frequently than expected by chance and were computationally predicted to reduce peptide-HLA binding nearly 10-fold on average. Characteristics associated with protective HLA alleles (defined using hazard ratios for progression to AIDS from natural history cohorts) included the potential to mount broad immune selection pressures across all HIV-1 proteins except Nef, the tendency to drive multisite and/or anchor residue escape mutations within known CTL epitopes, and the ability to strongly select mutations in conserved regions within HIV's structural and functional proteins. Thus, the factors defining protective cellular immune responses may be more complex than simply targeting conserved viral regions.

In this study, we characterize the cell-specificity in three key cells of the human immune system by building cis maps of regulatory regions with coordinated activity (CRDs) from ChIP-seq peaks and methylation data. We find that only 33\% of CRD-gene associations are shared between cell types, revealing how similarly located regulatory regions provide cell-specific modulation of gene activity. We emphasize important biological mechanisms, as most of our associations are enriched in cell-specific transcription factor binding sites, blood-traits, and immune disease-associated loci. Notably, we show that CRD-QTLs aid in interpreting GWAS findings and help prioritize variants for testing functional hypotheses within human complex diseases. Additionally, we map trans CRD regulatory associations, and among 207 trans-eQTLs discovered, 46 overlap with the QTLGen Consortium meta-analysis in whole blood, showing that mapping functional regulatory units using population genomics allows discovering important mechanisms in the regulation of gene expression in immune cells.

abstract = "Transcriptional regulation exhibits extensive robustness, but human genetics indicates sensitivity to transcription factor (TF) dosage. Reconciling such observations requires quantitative studies of TF dosage effects at trait-relevant ranges, largely lacking so far. TFs play central roles in both normal-range and disease-associated variation in craniofacial morphology; we therefore developed an approach to precisely modulate TF levels in human facial progenitor cells and applied it to SOX9, a TF associated with craniofacial variation and disease (Pierre Robin sequence (PRS)). Most SOX9-dependent regulatory elements (REs) are buffered against small decreases in SOX9 dosage, but REs directly and primarily regulated by SOX9 show heightened sensitivity to SOX9 dosage; these RE responses partially predict gene expression responses. Sensitive REs and genes preferentially affect functional chondrogenesis and PRS-like craniofacial shape variation. We propose that such REs and genes underlie the sensitivity of specific phenotypes to TF dosage, while buffering of other genes leads to robust, nonlinear dosage-to-phenotype relationships. SOX9 titration in neural crest cells identifies regulatory elements and genes with sensitive or buffered responses. Sensitive genes are enriched for craniofacial disorder genes phenocopying SOX9, suggesting differential sensitivity contributes to phenotypic specificity.",

Both transcription factors bind to E-boxes preferentially near the nucleosomal entry--exit sites. Structural studies with engineered or native nucleosome sequences show that MYC-MAX or CLOCK-BMAL1 triggers the release of DNA from histones to gain access. Atop the H2A--H2B acidic patch4, the CLOCK-BMAL1 Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) dimerization domains engage the histone octamer disc. Binding of tandem E-boxes5--7 at endogenous DNA sequences occurs through direct interactions between two CLOCK-BMAL1 protomers and histones and is important for circadian cycling. At internal E-boxes, the MYC-MAX leucine zipper can also interact with histones H2B and H3, and its binding is indirectly enhanced by OCT4 elsewhere on the nucleosome. The nucleosomal E-box position and the type of bHLH dimerization domain jointly determine the histone contact, the affinity and the degree of competition and cooperativity with other nucleosome-bound factors.",

Here, we report cryogenic electron microscopy structures in which a p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) multidomain monomer recognizes histone H4 N-terminal tail (NT) acetylation (ac) in a nucleosome and acetylates non-H4 histone NTs within the same nucleosome. p300/CBP not only recognized H4NTac via the bromodomain pocket responsible for reading, but also interacted with the DNA minor grooves via the outside of that pocket. This directed the catalytic center of p300/CBP to one of the non-H4 histone NTs. The primary target that p300 writes by reading H4NTac was H2BNT, and H2BNTac promoted H2A-H2B dissociation from the nucleosome. We propose a model in which p300/CBP replicates histone N-terminal tail acetylation within the H3-H4 tetramer to inherit epigenetic storage, and transcribes it from the H3-H4 tetramer to the H2B-H2A dimers to activate context-dependent gene transcription through local nucleosome destabilization. Histone acetylation activates gene transcription but its direct read/write mechanism is unknown.
